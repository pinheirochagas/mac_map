Participants were classified based on average cannabis use: frequent (> weekly) (n = 23), occasional (≤ weekly) (n = 83), and non-cannabis users (n=191) and were followed longitudinally for up to 10 years (average years of follow-up = 3.9). Multi-level models examined the effects of average and recent cannabis use on global cognition, global cognitive decline, and functional independence. Occasional cannabis users showed better global cognitive performance overall compared to non-cannabis users. Rates of cognitive decline and functional problems did not vary by average cannabis use. Recent cannabis use was linked to worse cognition at study visits when participants had THC+ urine toxicology-this short-term decrement in cognition was driven by worse memory and did not extend to reports of functional declines. Occasional (≤ weekly) cannabis use was associated with better global cognition over time in older adults with HIV, a group vulnerable to chronic inflammation and cognitive impairment. Recent THC exposure may have a temporary adverse impact on memory. To inform safe and efficacious medical cannabis use, the effects of specific cannabinoid doses on cognition and biological mechanisms must be investigated in older adults.",

As a result, we know little about the order of engagement across different brain regions during a given cognitive task. Using experimental arithmetic tasks as a prototype for human-unique symbolic processing, we recorded directly across 10,076 brain sites in 85 human subjects (52% female) using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Our data revealed a remarkably distributed change of activity in almost half of the sampled sites. Notably, an orderly successive activation of a set of brain regions - anatomically consistent across subjects-was observed in individual brains. Furthermore, the temporal order of activations across these sites was replicable across subjects and trials. Moreover, the degree of functional connectivity between the sites decreased as a function of temporal distance between regions, suggesting that information is partially leaked or transformed along the processing chain. Furthermore, in each activated region, distinct neuronal populations with opposite activity patterns during target and control conditions were juxtaposed in an anatomically orderly manner. Our study complements the prior imaging studies by providing hitherto unknown information about the timing of events in the brain during arithmetic processing. Such findings can be a basis for developing mechanistic computational models of human-specific cognitive symbolic systems.",

In the current work, we initiated a novel exploration of the ancient subcortical neural network essential for mathematical cognition. Using a neuropsychological approach, we report that degeneration of two subcortical structures, the cerebellum and basal ganglia, impairs performance in symbolic arithmetic. We identify distinct computational impairments in male and female participants with cerebellar degeneration (CD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). The CD group exhibited a disproportionate cost when the arithmetic sum increased, suggesting that the cerebellum is critical for iterative procedures required for calculations. The PD group showed a disproportionate cost for equations with increasing addends, suggesting that the basal ganglia are critical for chaining multiple operations. In Experiment 2, the two patient groups exhibited intact practice gains for repeated equations at odds with an alternative hypothesis that these impairments were related to memory retrieval. Notably, we discuss how the counting and chaining operations relate to cerebellar and basal ganglia function in other task domains (e.g., motor processes). Overall, we provide a novel perspective on how the cerebellum and basal ganglia contribute to symbolic arithmetic. Our studies demonstrate the constraints on the computational role of two subcortical regions in higher cognition.",

In this paper, we tested this hypothesis in a longitudinal study measuring language and visuospatial skills in 358 preschoolers, and testing their mental calculation skills at the beginning of middle school. Language skills at 5.5 years significantly predicted multiplication, but not addition nor subtraction scores at 11.5 years. Conversely, early visuospatial skills predicted addition and subtraction, but not multiplication scores. These results provide strong support for the existence of a double dissociation in mental arithmetic operations, and demonstrate the existence of long-lasting links between language/visuospatial skills and specific calculation abilities.",

In the present study, we recorded from the AG, supramarginal gyrus (SMG), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and superior parietal lobule (SPL) across 467 sites in 30 subjects performing addition or multiplication with digits or number words. We measured the power of high-frequency-broadband (HFB) signal, a surrogate marker for regional cortical engagement, and used single-subject anatomical boundaries to define the location of each recording site. Our recordings revealed the lowest proportion of sites with activation or deactivation within the AG compared to other subregions of the inferior parietal cortex during arithmetic processing. The few activated AG sites were mostly located at the border zones between AG and IPS, or AG and SMG. Additionally, we found that AG sites were more deactivated in trials with fast compared to slow response times. The increase or decrease of HFB within specific AG sites was the same when arithmetic trials were presented with number words versus digits and during multiplication as well as addition trials. Based on our findings, we conclude that the prior neuroimaging findings of so-called activations in the AG during arithmetic processing could have been due to group-based analyses that might have blurred the individual anatomical boundaries of AG or the subtractive nature of the neuroimaging methods in which lesser deactivations compared to the control condition have been interpreted as \"activations\".

Self- and other-mentalizing recruit near-identical cortical sites in a common spatiotemporal sequence. Activations begin in the visual cortex, followed by temporoparietal DMN regions, then finally in medial prefrontal regions. Moreover, regions with later activations exhibit stronger functional specificity for mentalizing, stronger associations with behavioral responses, and stronger self/other differentiation. Specifically, other-mentalizing evokes slower and longer activations than self-mentalizing across successive DMN regions, implying lengthier processing at higher levels of representation.

Numerous studies have suggested a close connection between visuospatial attention and arithmetic processing. However, the extant evidence in humans stems from neuroimaging methods that have relied on group analyses without much knowledge about the profile of neurophysiological engagement within localized neuronal populations at the individual brain level. Hence, it has remained unclear if the overlap of two functions in the PPC is the product of averaging, or they truly stem from a common profile of activity within the same neuronal populations in the human PPC. In the current study, we leveraged the anatomical precision and high signal-to-noise ratio of intracranial electrocorticography and probed the engagement of discrete PPC neuronal populations in seven neurosurgical patients (n = 179 total PPC sites covered; 26 sites on average per individual participant). We aimed to study the extent of parietal activations within each individual brain during visuospatial attention versus arithmetic tasks and the profile of electrophysiological responses within a given recording site during these tasks. Our findings indicated that about 40% of PPC sites did not respond to either visuospatial attention or arithmetic stimuli-or episodic memory conditions that were used as an adjunct control condition. Of those that were activated during either visuospatial attention or arithmetic conditions, a large majority showed overlapping responses during both visuospatial attention and arithmetic conditions. Most interestingly, responses during arithmetic processing were greatest in sites along the intraparietal sulcus region showing preference to contralateral, instead of ipsilateral, visual probes in the visuospatial attention task. Our results provide novel data about the relationship between numerical and spatial orientation at the neuronal population level and shed light on the complex functional organization of the PPC that could not be attained with noninvasive methods.",

Intracranial recordings confirmed the onset of seizures in the right dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, adjacent to the marginal sulcus, likely corresponding to Brodmann area 31. Upon the onset of seizures, the patient reported a reproducible sense of self-dissociation-a condition he described as a distorted awareness of the position of his body in space and feeling as if he had temporarily become an outside observer to his own thoughts, his \"me\" having become a separate entity that was listening to different parts of his brain speak to each other. Importantly, 50-Hz electrical stimulation of the seizure zone and a homotopical region within the contralateral PMC induced a subjectively similar state, reproducibly. We supplement our clinical findings with the definition of the patient's network anatomy at sites of interest using cortico-cortical-evoked potentials, experimental and resting-state electrophysiological connectivity, and individual-level functional imaging. This rare case of patient S19_137 highlights the potential causal importance of the PMC for integrating self-referential information and provides clues for future mechanistic studies of self-dissociation in neuropsychiatric populations.",

A major source of inequity is gender bias, which has a substantial negative impact on the careers, work-life balance, and mental health of underrepresented groups in science. Here, we argue that gender bias is not a single problem but manifests as a collection of distinct issues that impact researchers' lives. We disentangle these facets and propose concrete solutions that can be adopted by individuals, academic institutions, and society.",

A powerful yet simple behavioral method that can resolve this problem is finger trajectory tracking: by continuously tracking the finger position and speed as a participant chooses a response, and by analyzing which stimulus features affect the trajectory at each time point during the trial, we can estimate the absolute timing and order of each processing stage, and detect transient effects, changes of mind, serial versus parallel processing, and real-time fluctuations in subjective confidence. We suggest that trajectory tracking, which provides considerably more information than mere response times, may provide a comprehensive understanding of the fast temporal dynamics of cognitive operations.",

However, little is known about whether, and to what extent, non-verbal cognitive abilities, such as processing speed, are impacted in PPA patients. This is because neuropsychological tests typically contain linguistic stimuli and require spoken output, being therefore sensitive to verbal deficits in aphasic patients. The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in processing speed between PPA patients and healthy controls, and among the three PPA variants, using a brief non-verbal tablet-based task (Match) modeled after the WAIS-III digit symbol coding test, and to determine its neural correlates. Here, we compared performance on the Match task between PPA patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 59) and across the three PPA variants. We correlated performance on Match with voxelwise gray and white matter volumes. We found that lvPPA and nfvPPA patients performed significantly worse on Match than healthy controls and svPPA patients. Worse performance on Match across PPA patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in specific parts of the left middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus, and reduced white matter volume in the left parietal lobe. To conclude, our behavioral findings reveal that processing speed is differentially impacted across the three PPA variants and provide support for the potential clinical utility of a tabled-based task (Match) to assess non-verbal cognition. In addition, our neuroimaging findings confirm the importance of a set of fronto-parietal regions that previous research has associated with processing speed and executive control. Finally, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings combined indicate that differences in processing speed are largely explained by the unequal distribution of atrophy in these fronto-parietal regions across the three PPA variants.",

We analyzed speech, language, and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g., PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with etiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated utilizing linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS, and 6 PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by nonfluent speech, executive dysfunction, and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between FTLD neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance ([i] severity-agrammatism, [ii] prominent AOS, and [iii] prominent dysarthria). None of these data-driven LCD allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute, and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",

            "abstract": "The nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome primarily defined by the presence of apraxia of speech (AoS) and/or expressive agrammatism. In addition, many patients exhibit dysarthria and/or receptive agrammatism. This leads to substantial phenotypic variation within the speech-language domain across individuals and time, in terms of both the specific combination of symptoms as well as their severity. How to resolve such phenotypic heterogeneity in nfvPPA is a matter of debate. \"Splitting\" views propose separate clinical entities: \"primary progressive apraxia of speech\" (PPAOS) when AoS occurs in the absence of expressive agrammatism, \"progressive agrammatic aphasia\" (PAA) in the opposite case, and \"AOS + PAA\" when mixed motor speech and language symptoms are clearly present. While therapeutic interventions typically vary depending on the predominant symptom (e.g., AoS vs expressive agrammatism), the existence of behavioral, anatomical, and pathological overlap across these phenotypes argues against drawing such clear-cut boundaries. In the current study, we contribute to this debate by mapping behavior to brain in a large, prospective cohort of well-characterized patients with nfvPPA (n = 104). We sought to advance scientific understanding of nfvPPA and the neural basis of speech-language by uncovering where in the brain the degree of MRI-based atrophy is associated with inter-patient variability in the presence and severity of AoS, dysarthria, expressive agrammatism, or receptive agrammatism. Our cross-sectional examination of brain-behavior relationships revealed three main observations. First, we found that the neural correlates of AoS and expressive agrammatism in nfvPPA lie side by side in the left posterior inferior frontal lobe, explaining their behavioral dissociation/association in previous reports. Second, we identified a \"left-right\" and \"ventral-dorsal\" neuroanatomical distinction between AoS versus dysarthria, highlighting (i) that dysarthria, but not AoS, is significantly influenced by tissue loss in right-hemisphere motor-speech regions and (ii) that, within the left hemisphere, dysarthria and AoS map onto dorsally versus ventrally located motor-speech regions, respectively. Third, we confirmed that, within the large-scale grammar network, left frontal tissue loss is preferentially involved in expressive agrammatism and left temporal tissue loss in receptive agrammatism. Our findings thus contribute to define the function and location of the epicenters within the large-scale neural networks vulnerable to neurodegenerative changes in nfvPPA. We propose that nfvPPA be redefined as an umbrella term subsuming a spectrum of speech and/or language phenotypes that are closely linked by the underlying neuroanatomy and neuropathology.",

As a complement to classic tests, scalable and low-cost digital tools can capture relevant anomalies automatically, potentially supporting the quest for globally equitable markers of brain health. However, this promise remains unfulfilled due to limited linguistic diversity in scientific works and clinical instruments. Here we argue for cross-linguistic research as a core strategy to counter this problem. First, we survey the contributions of linguistic assessments in the study of primary progressive aphasia and the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders worldwide-Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Second, we address two forms of linguistic unfairness in the literature: the neglect of most of the world's 7000 languages and the preponderance of English-speaking cohorts. Third, we review studies showing that linguistic dysfunctions in a given disorder may vary depending on the patient's language and that English speakers offer a suboptimal benchmark for other language groups. Finally, we highlight different approaches, tools and initiatives for cross-linguistic research, identifying core challenges for their deployment. Overall, we seek to inspire timely actions to counter a looming source of inequity in behavioural neurology.",

This study investigated the diagnostic utility of visuospatial profiles and examined their neural basis among the three main primary progressive aphasia variants. We studied the neuropsychological performances of 118 primary progressive aphasia participants and 30 cognitively normal controls, across 11 measures of visuospatial cognition, and investigated their neural correlates via voxel-based morphometry analysis using visuospatial composite scores derived from principal component analysis. The principal component analysis identified three main factors: visuospatial-executive, visuospatial-memory and visuomotor components. Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia performed significantly worst across all components; nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia showed deficits in the visuospatial-executive and visuomotor components compared with controls; and the semantic variant primary progressive aphasia scored significantly lower than nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia and control in the visuospatial-memory component. Grey matter volumes over the right parieto-occipital cortices correlated with visuospatial-executive performance; volumetric changes in the right anterior parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala were associated with visuospatial-memory function, and visuomotor composite scores correlated significantly with the grey matter volume at the right precentral gyrus. Discriminant function analysis identified three visuospatial measures: Visual Object and Space Perception and Benson figure copy and recall test, which classified 79.7% (94/118) of primary progressive aphasia into their specific variant. This study shows that each primary progressive aphasia variant also carries a distinctive visuospatial cognitive profile that corresponds with grey matter volumetric changes and in turn can be largely represented by their performance on the visuomotor, visuospatial-memory and executive functions.",

We further establish the link between functional variants and target genes by single-cell CRISPRi screening in microglia. In addition, we show that AD variants exhibit allelic imbalance on target gene expression. In particular, rs7922621 is the effective variant in controlling TSPAN14 expression among other nominated variants in the same cCRE and exerts multiple physiological effects including reduced cell surface ADAM10 and altered soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) shedding. Our work represents a systematic approach to prioritize and characterize AD-associated variants and provides a roadmap for advancing genetic association to experimentally validated cell-type-specific phenotypes and mechanisms.",

We developed an efficient 8-day protocol for the generation of microglia-like cells based on the inducible expression of six transcription factors. We established inducible CRISPR interference and activation in this system and conducted three screens targeting the 'druggable genome'. These screens uncovered genes controlling microglia survival, activation and phagocytosis, including neurodegeneration-associated genes. A screen with single-cell RNA sequencing as the readout revealed that these microglia adopt a spectrum of states mirroring those observed in human brains and identified regulators of these states. A disease-associated state characterized by osteopontin (SPP1) expression was selectively depleted by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1R) inhibition. Thus, our platform can systematically uncover regulators of microglial states, enabling their functional characterization and therapeutic targeting.",

However, human neurons cultured in vitro typically do not fully recapitulate the physiology of the human nervous system, especially in terms of exhibiting morphological maturation, longevity, and electrochemical signaling ability comparable to that of adult human neurons. In this study, we investigated the potential for astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to modulate survival and electrophysiological function of human neurons in vitro. Specifically, we demonstrate that EVs obtained from human astrocytes promote enhanced single cell electrophysiological function and anti-apoptotic behavior in a homogeneous population of human iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Furthermore, EV-proteomic analysis was performed to identify cargo proteins with the potential to promote the physiological enhancement observed. EV cargos were found to include neuroprotective proteins such as heat shock proteins, alpha-synuclein, and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), as well as apolipoprotein E (APOE), which negatively regulates neuronal apoptosis, and a peroxidasin homolog that supports neuronal oxidative stress management. Proteins that positively regulate neuronal excitability and synaptic development were also detected, such as potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 12 (KCTD12), glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B), spectrin-alpha non-erythrocytic1 (SPTAN1). The remarkable improvements in electrophysiological function and evident inhibition of apoptotic signaling in cultured neurons exposed to these cargos may hold significance for improving preclinical in vitro screening modalities. In addition, our collected data highlight the potential for EV-based therapeutics as a potential class of future clinical treatment for tackling inveterate central and peripheral neuropathies.",

While surgical intervention remains the first-line therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery is increasingly recognized as a viable treatment option for these often challenging tumors. In this review, we comprehensively review the literature to evaluate both endocrinologic and radiographic outcomes of radiosurgical management of pituitary adenomas. The literature clearly supports the use of radiosurgery, with endocrinologic remission rates and time to remission varying by tumor type [prolactinoma: 20-30%, growth hormone secreting adenomas: ~50%, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting adenomas: 40-65%] and radiographic control rates almost universally greater than 90% with long-term follow-up. We stratify the outcomes by tumor type, review the importance of prognostic factors (particularly, pre-treatment endocrinologic function and tumor size), and discuss the complications of treatment (with special attention to endocrinopathy and visual complications). We conclude that the literature supports the use of radiosurgery for treatment-refractory pituitary adenomas, providing the patient with a minimally invasive, safe, and effective treatment option for an otherwise resistant tumor. As such, we provide literature-based treatment considerations, including radiosurgical dose, endocrinologic, radiographic, and medical considerations for each adenoma type.",

Neuronal dysfunction and degeneration contribute to progressive physiological, motor, cognitive, and emotional disturbances characteristic of HD. A major impetus for research into the treatment of HD has centered on cell therapy strategies to protect vulnerable neuronal cell populations or to replace dysfunctional or dying cells. The work underlying 3 approaches to HD cell therapy includes the potential for self-repair through the manipulation of endogenous stem cells and/or neurogenesis, the use of fetal or stem cell transplantation as a cell replacement strategy, and the administration of neurotrophic factors to protect susceptible neuronal populations. These approaches have shown some promising results in animal models of HD. Although striatal transplantation of fetal-derived cells has undergone clinical assessment since the 1990s, many cell therapy strategies have yet to be applied in the clinic environment. A more thorough understanding of the pathophysiologies underlying HD as well as the response of both endogenous and exogenous cells to the degenerating brain will inform their merit as potential therapeutic agents and enhance the framework by which the success of such strategies are determined.",

Linear regression models examined memory as a function of hippocampal QSM, PA, and their interaction. Higher bilateral hippocampal iron deposition correlated with worse memory but was not strongly related to PA.

We show that CT-KIBRA restores plasticity and memory in transgenic mice expressing pathogenic human tau; however, CT-KIBRA did not alter tau levels or prevent tau-induced synapse loss. Instead, we find that CT-KIBRA binds to and stabilizes protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) to maintain synaptic plasticity and memory despite tau-mediated pathogenesis. In humans we find that reduced KIBRA in brain and increased KIBRA in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with cognitive impairment and pathological tau levels in disease. Thus, our results distinguish KIBRA both as a novel biomarker of synapse dysfunction in AD and as the foundation for a synapse repair mechanism to reverse cognitive impairment in tauopathy.",

Daily average step count, sedentary time (0 steps/min), and high-intensity time (≥120 steps/min) were calculated. Participants completed neurocognitive testing assessing cognitive domains of executive functioning and memory; medical history, from which vascular burden (i.e., a count of cardiovascular conditions) was calculated; and brain MRI (n = 44). Subgroups with similar PA patterns were identified via latent profile analysis. Three latent PA classes emerged: Class 1",

In the presence of a low serum calcium level, the vitamin D metabolic pathway is called upon to produce more of the active vitamin D hormone, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1, 25-D), via up-regulation of the CYP27b1-hydroxylase activity in the kidney. The consequence is mobilization of skeletal calcium stores to return the circulating calcium level back to the normal range. On the other hand, when the serum calcium level increases, endocrine forces move to suppress renal 1, 25D production and squelch bone resorption. It is now known that vitamin D metabolites also operate in an autocrine, paracrine and intracrine mode to control vitamin D receptor-directed biological responses at the tissue level. Because the metabolism and action of vitamin D occurs at the tissue level in this situation, use of circulating vitamin D metabolites and biomarkers to ascertain the local action of the vitamin D pathway is often misleading. This mini-review seeks to compare and contrast the operation of the vitamin D pathway at the endocrine and tissue level.",

The extent to which dominantly inherited and sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease overlap is unknown. In this study, we explored the clinical, cognitive and biomarker profiles of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, focusing on commonalities and distinctions between dominantly inherited and sporadic cases. Our analysis included 117 participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and 118 individuals with sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease enrolled at the University of California San Francisco Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Baseline differences in clinical and biomarker profiles between both groups were compared using ",

In neurodegenerative disease research, remote digital cognitive assessments and unobtrusive sensors are gaining traction for their potential to improve early detection and monitoring of cognitive impairment. Given the high prevalence of cognitive impairments in T2D, these digital tools are highly relevant. Further research incorporating remote digital biomarkers of cognition, behavior, and motor functioning may enable comprehensive characterizations of patients with T2D and may ultimately improve clinical care and equitable access to research participation. The aim of this commentary article is to review the feasibility, validity, and limitations of using remote digital cognitive tests and unobtrusive detection methods to identify and monitor cognitive decline in neurodegenerative conditions and apply these insights to patients with T2D.",

While these morphometric changes, especially those affecting gray matter and atrophy of the temporal lobe, are predictors of cognitive performance, the strong association with aging obscures the potential parallel, but more specific role, of individual subject physiology. Here, we studied a cohort of 554 human subjects who were monitored using structural MRI scans and blood immune protein concentrations. Using machine learning, we derived a cytokine clock (CyClo), which predicted age with good accuracy (Mean Absolute Error = 6 y) based on the expression of a subset of immune proteins. These proteins included, among others, Placenta Growth Factor (PLGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), both involved in angiogenesis, the chemoattractant vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), the canonical inflammatory proteins interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), the chemoattractant IP-10 (CXCL10), and eotaxin-1 (CCL11), previously involved in brain disorders. Age, sex, and the CyClo were independently associated with different functionally defined cortical networks in the brain. While age was mostly correlated with changes in the somatomotor system, sex was associated with variability in the frontoparietal, ventral attention, and visual networks. Significant canonical correlation was observed for the CyClo and the default mode, limbic, and dorsal attention networks, indicating that immune circulating proteins preferentially affect brain processes such as focused attention, emotion, memory, response to social stress, internal evaluation, and access to consciousness. Thus, we identified immune biomarkers of brain aging which could be potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of age-related cognitive decline.",

We developed multimodal models for f-FTD disease progression and estimated clinical trial sample sizes in C9orf72, GRN and MAPT mutation carriers. Models included longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological scores, regional brain volumes and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) in 796 carriers and 412 noncarrier controls. We found that the temporal ordering of clinical and biomarker progression differed by genotype. In prevention-trial simulations using model-based patient selection, atrophy and NfL were the best endpoints, whereas clinical measures were potential endpoints in early symptomatic trials. f-FTD prevention trials are feasible but will likely require global recruitment efforts. These disease progression models will facilitate the planning of f-FTD clinical trials, including the selection of optimal endpoints and enrollment criteria to maximize power to detect treatment effects.",

We used covariate-adjusted binary logistic regression models to identify independent associations between variables and LC symptoms.RESULTSWe observed that LC symptoms, such as fatigue and neurocognitive dysfunction, at a median of 4 months following initial diagnosis were independently associated with serological evidence suggesting recent EBV reactivation (early antigen-diffuse IgG positivity) or high nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG levels but not with ongoing EBV viremia. Serological evidence suggesting recent EBV reactivation (early antigen-diffuse IgG positivity) was most strongly associated with fatigue (OR = 2.12). Underlying HIV infection was also independently associated with neurocognitive LC (OR = 2.5). Interestingly, participants who had serologic evidence of prior CMV infection were less likely to develop neurocognitive LC (OR = 0.52).CONCLUSIONOverall, these findings suggest differential effects of chronic viral coinfections on the likelihood of developing LC and association with distinct syndromic patterns.

To date, there has not been discussion of persistent neurocognitive deficits in patients with milder COVID-19. We present two cases of non-hospitalized patients recovering from COVID-19 with persistent neurocognitive symptoms. Commonly used cognitive screens were normal, while more detailed testing revealed working memory and executive functioning deficits. An observational cohort study of individuals recovering from COVID-19 (14 or more days following symptom onset) identified that among the first 100 individuals enrolled, 14 were non-hospitalized patients reporting persistent cognitive issues. These 14 participants had a median age of 39 years (interquartile range: 35-56), and cognitive symptoms were present for at least a median of 98 days (interquartile range: 71-120 following acute COVID-19 symptoms); no participants with follow-up evaluation reported symptom resolution. We discuss potential mechanisms to be explored in future studies, including direct viral effects, indirect consequences of immune activation, and immune dysregulation causing auto-antibody production.",

However, little is known about whether, and to what extent, non-verbal cognitive abilities, such as processing speed, are impacted in PPA patients. This is because neuropsychological tests typically contain linguistic stimuli and require spoken output, being therefore sensitive to verbal deficits in aphasic patients. The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in processing speed between PPA patients and healthy controls, and among the three PPA variants, using a brief non-verbal tablet-based task (Match) modeled after the WAIS-III digit symbol coding test, and to determine its neural correlates. Here, we compared performance on the Match task between PPA patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 59) and across the three PPA variants. We correlated performance on Match with voxelwise gray and white matter volumes. We found that lvPPA and nfvPPA patients performed significantly worse on Match than healthy controls and svPPA patients. Worse performance on Match across PPA patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in specific parts of the left middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus, and reduced white matter volume in the left parietal lobe. To conclude, our behavioral findings reveal that processing speed is differentially impacted across the three PPA variants and provide support for the potential clinical utility of a tabled-based task (Match) to assess non-verbal cognition. In addition, our neuroimaging findings confirm the importance of a set of fronto-parietal regions that previous research has associated with processing speed and executive control. Finally, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings combined indicate that differences in processing speed are largely explained by the unequal distribution of atrophy in these fronto-parietal regions across the three PPA variants.",

The known disease-associated Annexin A11 (ANXA11) mutations result in ANXA11 aggregation, alterations in lysosomal-RNA granule co-trafficking, and TDP-43 mis-localization and present as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia. We identified a novel VUS in ANXA11 (P93S) in a kindred with corticobasal syndrome and unique radiographic features that segregated with disease. We then queried neurodegenerative disorder clinic databases to identify the phenotypic spread of ANXA11 mutations. Multi-modal computational analysis of this variant was performed and the effect of this VUS on ANXA11 function and TDP-43 biology was characterized in iPSC-derived neurons. Single-cell sequencing and proteomic analysis of iPSC-derived neurons and microglia were used to determine the multiomic signature of this VUS. Mutations in ANXA11 were found in association with clinically diagnosed corticobasal syndrome, thereby establishing corticobasal syndrome as part of ANXA11 clinical spectrum. In iPSC-derived neurons expressing mutant ANXA11, we found decreased colocalization of lysosomes and decreased neuritic RNA as well as decreased nuclear TDP-43 and increased formation of cryptic exons compared to controls. Multiomic assessment of the P93S variant in iPSC-derived neurons and microglia indicates that the pathogenic omic signature in neurons is modest compared to microglia. Additionally, omic studies reveal that immune dysregulation and interferon signaling pathways in microglia are central to disease. Collectively, these findings identify a new pathogenic variant in ANXA11, expand the range of clinical syndromes caused by ANXA11 mutations, and implicate both neuronal and microglia dysfunction in ANXA11 pathophysiology. This work illustrates the potential for iPSC-derived cellular models to revolutionize the variant annotation process and provides a generalizable approach to determining causality of novel variants across genes.",

Multiple lines of evidence from human disease, as well as nonclinical translational models, suggest that tau has a central pathologic role in these disorders, historically thought to be primarily related to tau gain of toxic function. However, a number of tau-targeting therapies with various mechanisms of action have shown little promise in clinical trials in different tauopathies. We review what is known about tau biology, genetics, and therapeutic mechanisms that have been tested in clinical trials to date. We discuss possible reasons for failures of these therapies, such as use of imperfect nonclinical models that do not predict human effects for drug development; heterogeneity of human tau pathologies which may lead to variable responses to therapy; and ineffective therapeutic mechanisms, such as targeting of the wrong tau species or protein epitope. Innovative approaches to human clinical trials can help address some of the difficulties that have plagued our field's development of tau-targeting therapies thus far. Despite limited clinical success to date, as we continue to refine our understanding of tau's pathogenic mechanism(s) in different neurodegenerative diseases, we remain optimistic that tau-targeting therapies will eventually play a central role in the treatment of tauopathies.",

Our cohort is comprised of 426 progressive supranuclear palsy cases, of which 367 had at least one follow-up scan, and 290 controls. Of the progressive supranuclear palsy cases, 357 were clinically diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson, 52 with a progressive supranuclear palsy-cortical variant (progressive supranuclear palsy-frontal, progressive supranuclear palsy-speech/language, or progressive supranuclear palsy-corticobasal), and 17 with a progressive supranuclear palsy-subcortical variant (progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism or progressive supranuclear palsy-progressive gait freezing). Subtype and Stage Inference was applied to volumetric MRI features extracted from baseline structural (T1-weighted) MRI scans and then used to subtype and stage follow-up scans. The subtypes and stages at follow-up were used to validate the longitudinal consistency of subtype and stage assignments. We further compared the clinical phenotypes of each subtype to gain insight into the relationship between progressive supranuclear palsy pathology, atrophy patterns, and clinical presentation. The data supported two subtypes, each with a distinct progression of atrophy: a 'subcortical' subtype, in which early atrophy was most prominent in the brainstem, ventral diencephalon, superior cerebellar peduncles, and the dentate nucleus, and a 'cortical' subtype, in which there was early atrophy in the frontal lobes and the insula alongside brainstem atrophy. There was a strong association between clinical diagnosis and the Subtype and Stage Inference subtype with 82% of progressive supranuclear palsy-subcortical cases and 81% of progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson cases assigned to the subcortical subtype and 82% of progressive supranuclear palsy-cortical cases assigned to the cortical subtype. The increasing stage was associated with worsening clinical scores, whilst the 'subcortical' subtype was associated with worse clinical severity scores compared to the 'cortical subtype' (progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Validation experiments showed that subtype assignment was longitudinally stable (95% of scans were assigned to the same subtype at follow-up) and individual staging was longitudinally consistent with 90% remaining at the same stage or progressing to a later stage at follow-up. In summary, we applied Subtype and Stage Inference to structural MRI data and empirically identified two distinct subtypes of spatiotemporal atrophy in progressive supranuclear palsy. These image-based subtypes were differentially enriched for progressive supranuclear palsy clinical syndromes and showed different clinical characteristics. Being able to accurately subtype and stage progressive supranuclear palsy patients at baseline has important implications for screening patients on entry to clinical trials, as well as tracking disease progression.",

While a subset of α-synuclein, TDP-43 and tau mutations has been shown to increase the structural propensity of these proteins toward self-association, rates of aggregation are also highly dependent on protein steady state concentrations, which are in large part regulated by their rates of lysosomal degradation. Previous studies have shown that lysosomal proteases operate precisely and not indiscriminately, cleaving their substrates at very specific linear amino acid sequences. With this knowledge, we hypothesized that certain coding mutations in α-synuclein, TDP-43 and tau may lead to increased protein steady state concentrations and eventual aggregation by an alternative mechanism, that is, through disrupting lysosomal protease cleavage recognition motifs and subsequently conferring protease resistance to these proteins.",

While performing experiments with a HIS-tagged recombinant human (rh) PGRN protein, we observed a measurable depletion of protein from solution due to its adsorption onto polypropylene (PPE) microcentrifuge tubes. In this study, we have quantified the extent of rhPGRN adsorption to PPE tubes while varying experimental conditions, including incubation time and temperature. We found that ∼25-35% of rhPGRN becomes adsorbed to the surface of PPE tubes even after a short incubation period. We then directly showed the deleterious impact of PGRN adsorption in functional assays and have recommended alternative labware to minimize these effects. Although the risk of adsorption of some purified proteins and peptides to polymer plastics has been characterized previously, this is the first report of rhPGRN adsorption.

Normal cortical function depends upon the proper elaboration of neurons, including the initial extension of cellular processes that lead to the formation of axons and dendrites and the subsequent maturation of synapses. Here, we examine the role of cell-based signaling via the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA7 in guiding the extension and maturation of cortical dendrites. EphA7, localized to dendritic shafts and spines of pyramidal cells, is uniquely expressed during cortical neuronal development. On patterned substrates, EphA7 signaling restricts dendritic extent, with Src and Tsc1 serving as downstream mediators. Perturbation of EphA7 signaling in vitro and in vivo alters dendritic elaboration: Dendrites are longer and more complex when EphA7 is absent and are shorter and simpler when EphA7 is ectopically expressed. Later in neuronal maturation, EphA7 influences protrusions from dendritic shafts and the assembling of synaptic components. Indeed, synaptic function relies on EphA7; the electrophysiological maturation of pyramidal neurons is delayed in cultures lacking EphA7, indicating that EphA7 enhances synaptic function. These results provide evidence of roles for Eph signaling, first in limiting the elaboration of cortical neuronal dendrites and then in coordinating the maturation and function of synapses.",

This rarity and complexity have led many to only offer nonsurgical therapies. The surgical outcomes for patients with SBM therefore remain unknown. Design Retrospective, comparison analyses. Setting Johns Hopkins Hospital. Participants All patients who underwent intracranial metastatic tumor surgery. Main Outcome Measure Survival and recurrence. Results Of the 708 patients who underwent intracranial metastatic tumor surgery, 29 (4%) had SBM: 3 (10%) involved the anterior skull base, 7 (24%) the sella, 6 (21%) the orbit, 2 (7%) the sphenoid wing, 3 (10%) the clivus, 4 (14%) the petrous bone, and 4 (14%) the paranasal sinuses. Following surgery, 6 (50%) had improvements in vision and 14 (88%) had improvement and/or maintenance of their cranial nerve symptoms. Three (10%), 0(0%), and 1(3%) developed a new motor, language, and vision deficit, respectively. There were no differences in median survival (10.0 versus 9.2 months, p = 0.48) and local progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.52), but there was improved distal PFS (p = 0.04) between patients with and without SBM. Conclusions Patients with SBM are relatively rare. These patients can tolerate surgery with minimal morbidity and mortality, and they have similar prognoses to patients without SBM.",

Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.",

Whether ANS patterns accompany emotions, or arise in basal physiology, remain unsettled questions in the field. Here, we searched for brief ANS patterns amidst continuous, multichannel physiological recordings in 45 healthy older adults. Participants completed an emotional reactivity task in which they viewed video clips that elicited a target emotion (awe, sadness, amusement, disgust, or nurturant love); each video clip was preceded by a pre-trial baseline period and followed by a post-trial recovery period. Participants also sat quietly for a separate 2-min resting period to assess basal physiology. Using principal components analysis and unsupervised clustering algorithms to reduce the second-by-second physiological data during the emotional reactivity task, we uncovered five ANS states. Each ANS state was characterized by a unique constellation of patterned physiological changes that differentiated among the trials of the emotional reactivity task. These ANS states emerged and dissipated over time, with each instance lasting several seconds on average. ANS states with similar structures were also detectable in the resting period but were intermittent and of smaller magnitude. Our results offer new insights into the functional organization of the ANS. By assembling short-lived, patterned changes, the ANS is equipped to generate a wide range of physiological states that accompany emotions and that contribute to the architecture of basal physiology.",

We find that each dimension represents a dynamic activity gradient, including a primary unipolar sensory-association gradient underlying the global signal. The gradients appear stable across individuals and cognitive states, while recapitulating key functional connectivity properties including anticorrelation, modularity, and regional hubness. We then use dynamical systems modeling to show that gradients causally interact via state-specific coupling parameters to create distinct brain activity patterns. Together, these findings indicate that a set of dynamic, intrinsic spatial gradients interact to determine the repertoire of possible brain activity states.",

In a small cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, we previously found an atypical, neuroglial tauopathy in cases harboring a TMEM106B rs1990622 A/A genotype. To test whether TMEM106B genotype affects the risk of developing atypical tauopathy under a recessive genotype model (presence versus absence of two major alleles: A/A vs. A/G and G/G). We characterized the atypical tauopathy neuropathologically and determined its frequency by TMEM106B rs1990622 genotypes in 90 postmortem cases with a primary diagnosis of FTLD/ALS-TDP [mean age at death 65.5 years (±8.1), 40% female]. We investigated the effect of this new atypical tauopathy on demographics and clinical and neuropsychological metrics. We also genotyped TMEM106B in an independent series with phenotypically similar cases. Sixteen cases (16/90, 17.7 %) showed the temporal-predominant neuro-astroglial tauopathy, and 93.7% of them carried an A/A genotype (vs. ~35% in a population cohort). The odds ratio of FTLD/ALS-TDP individuals with the A/A genotype showing neuro-astroglial tauopathy was 13.9. Individuals with this tauopathy were older at onset (p = 0.01). The validation cohort had a similarly high proportion of rs1990622 A/A genotype. TDP-43 and tau changes co-occur in a subset of neurons. Our data add to the growing body of evidence that TMEM106B polymorphisms may modulate neurodegeneration.

In behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a disorder of social-emotional function, von Economo neurons (VENs), and fork cells are among the initial neuronal targets. These large layer 5 projection neurons are concentrated in the anterior cingulate and frontoinsular (FI) cortices, regions that anchor the salience network, a large-scale system linked to social-emotional function. Here, we studied patients with bvFTD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or both, given that these syndromes share common pathobiological and genetic factors. Our goal was to determine how neuron type-specific TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) pathobiology relates to atrophy in specific brain structures and to loss of emotional empathy, a cardinal feature of bvFTD. We combined questionnaire-based empathy assessments, in vivo structural MR imaging, and quantitative histopathological data from 16 patients across the bvFTD/ALS spectrum. We show that TDP-43 pathobiology within right FI VENs and fork cells is associated with salience network atrophy spanning insular, medial frontal, and thalamic regions. Gray matter degeneration within these structures mediated loss of emotional empathy, suggesting a chain of influence linking the cellular, regional/network, and behavioral levels in producing signature bvFTD clinical features.",

We tested for effects of DAT1 and BDNF polymorphisms on cross-sectional and longitudinal β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau pathology (measured with positron emission tomography (PET)), hippocampal volume, and cognition. We analyzed a sample of cognitively normal older adults (cross-sectional n = 321) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). DAT1 and BDNF interacted to predict Aβ-PET, tau-PET, and hippocampal atrophy. Carriers of both \"non-boptimal\" DAT1 C and BDNF Met alleles demonstrated greater pathology and atrophy. Our findings provide novel links between dopamine and neurotrophic factor genes and AD pathology, consistent with previous research implicating these variants in greater risk for developing AD.",

The etiology of dementia is poorly understood, and the lack of robust biomarkers in diverse, population-representative samples is a barrier to moving dementia research forward. Existing biomarkers and other pathology measures derived from neuropathology, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid samples, are commonly collected in predominantly White and highly-educated samples drawn from academic medical centers in urban settings. Blood-based biomarkers are non-invasive and less expensive, offering promise to expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of dementia, including in participants from historically-excluded groups. Although largely not yet FDA-approved or used in clinical settings, blood-based biomarkers are increasingly included in epidemiologic studies on dementia. Blood-based biomarkers in epidemiologic research may allow the field to more accurately understand the multifactorial etiology and sequence of events that characterize dementia-related pathophysiological changes. As blood-based dementia biomarkers continue to be developed and incorporated into research and practice, we outline considerations for using them in dementia epidemiology, and illustrate key concepts with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (2003-present) data. We focus on measurement, including both validity and reliability, and on the use of dementia blood-based biomarkers to promote equity in dementia research and cognitive aging.",

For early-onset AD patients without an identified autosomal dominant cause, we hypothesized that their early-onset disease reflects further enrichment of the common risk-conferring single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. We applied a previously validated polygenic hazard score for late-onset AD to 193 consecutive patients diagnosed at our tertiary dementia referral center with symptomatic early-onset AD. For comparison, we included 179 participants with late-onset AD and 70 healthy controls. Polygenic hazard scores were similar in early- versus late-onset AD. The polygenic hazard score was not associated with age-of-onset or disease biomarkers within early-onset AD. Early-onset AD does not represent an extreme enrichment of the common single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. Further exploration of novel genetic risk factors of this highly heritable disease is warranted.",

We analyzed speech, language, and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g., PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with etiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated utilizing linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS, and 6 PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by nonfluent speech, executive dysfunction, and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between FTLD neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance ([i] severity-agrammatism, [ii] prominent AOS, and [iii] prominent dysarthria). None of these data-driven LCD allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute, and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",

Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.",

            "abstract": "Despite much effort, antibody therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown limited efficacy. Challenges to the rational design of effective antibodies include the difficulty of achieving specific affinity to critical targets, poor expression, and antibody aggregation caused by buried charges and unstructured loops. To overcome these challenges, we grafted previously determined sequences of fibril-capping amyloid inhibitors onto a camel heavy chain antibody scaffold. These sequences were designed to cap fibrils of tau, known to form the neurofibrillary tangles of AD, thereby preventing fibril elongation. The nanobodies grafted with capping inhibitors blocked tau aggregation in biosensor cells seeded with postmortem brain extracts from AD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. The tau capping nanobody inhibitors also blocked seeding by recombinant tau oligomers. Another challenge to the design of effective antibodies is their poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. In this study, we also designed a bispecific nanobody composed of a nanobody that targets a receptor on the BBB and a tau capping nanobody inhibitor, conjoined by a flexible linker. We provide evidence that the bispecific nanobody improved BBB penetration over the tau capping inhibitor alone after intravenous administration in mice. Our results suggest that the design of synthetic antibodies that target sequences that drive protein aggregation may be a promising approach to inhibit the prion-like seeding of tau and other proteins involved in AD and related proteinopathies.",

            "abstract": "The nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome primarily defined by the presence of apraxia of speech (AoS) and/or expressive agrammatism. In addition, many patients exhibit dysarthria and/or receptive agrammatism. This leads to substantial phenotypic variation within the speech-language domain across individuals and time, in terms of both the specific combination of symptoms as well as their severity. How to resolve such phenotypic heterogeneity in nfvPPA is a matter of debate. \"Splitting\" views propose separate clinical entities: \"primary progressive apraxia of speech\" (PPAOS) when AoS occurs in the absence of expressive agrammatism, \"progressive agrammatic aphasia\" (PAA) in the opposite case, and \"AOS + PAA\" when mixed motor speech and language symptoms are clearly present. While therapeutic interventions typically vary depending on the predominant symptom (e.g., AoS vs expressive agrammatism), the existence of behavioral, anatomical, and pathological overlap across these phenotypes argues against drawing such clear-cut boundaries. In the current study, we contribute to this debate by mapping behavior to brain in a large, prospective cohort of well-characterized patients with nfvPPA (n = 104). We sought to advance scientific understanding of nfvPPA and the neural basis of speech-language by uncovering where in the brain the degree of MRI-based atrophy is associated with inter-patient variability in the presence and severity of AoS, dysarthria, expressive agrammatism, or receptive agrammatism. Our cross-sectional examination of brain-behavior relationships revealed three main observations. First, we found that the neural correlates of AoS and expressive agrammatism in nfvPPA lie side by side in the left posterior inferior frontal lobe, explaining their behavioral dissociation/association in previous reports. Second, we identified a \"left-right\" and \"ventral-dorsal\" neuroanatomical distinction between AoS versus dysarthria, highlighting (i) that dysarthria, but not AoS, is significantly influenced by tissue loss in right-hemisphere motor-speech regions and (ii) that, within the left hemisphere, dysarthria and AoS map onto dorsally versus ventrally located motor-speech regions, respectively. Third, we confirmed that, within the large-scale grammar network, left frontal tissue loss is preferentially involved in expressive agrammatism and left temporal tissue loss in receptive agrammatism. Our findings thus contribute to define the function and location of the epicenters within the large-scale neural networks vulnerable to neurodegenerative changes in nfvPPA. We propose that nfvPPA be redefined as an umbrella term subsuming a spectrum of speech and/or language phenotypes that are closely linked by the underlying neuroanatomy and neuropathology.",

            "abstract": "Tauopathies are a heterogenous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by tau aggregation in the brain. In a subset of tauopathies, rare mutations in the MAPT gene, which encodes the tau protein, are sufficient to cause disease; however, the events downstream of MAPT mutations are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcripts >200 nucleotides with low/no coding potential that regulate transcription and translation, and their role in tauopathy. Using stem cell derived neurons from patients carrying a MAPT p.P301L, IVS10 + 16, or p.R406W mutation and CRISPR-corrected isogenic controls, we identified transcriptomic changes that occur as a function of the MAPT mutant allele. We identified 15 lncRNAs that were commonly differentially expressed across the three MAPT mutations. The commonly differentially expressed lncRNAs interact with RNA-binding proteins that regulate stress granule formation. Among these lncRNAs, SNHG8 was significantly reduced in a mouse model of tauopathy and in FTLD-tau, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Alzheimer's disease brains. We show that SNHG8 interacts with tau and stress granule-associated RNA-binding protein TIA1. Overexpression of mutant tau in vitro is sufficient to reduce SNHG8 expression and induce stress granule formation. Rescuing SNHG8 expression leads to reduced stress granule formation and reduced TIA1 levels in immortalized cells and in MAPT mutant neurons, suggesting that dysregulation of this non-coding RNA is a causal factor driving stress granule formation via TIA1 in tauopathies.",

            "abstract": "Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia is characterized by heterogeneous frontal, insular, and anterior temporal atrophy patterns that vary along left-right and dorso-ventral axes. Little is known about how these structural imbalances impact clinical symptomatology. The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of frontotemporal asymmetry (right- or left-lateralization) and dorsality (ventral or dorsal predominance of atrophy) and to investigate their clinical correlates. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and structural images were analyzed for 250 patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal atrophy was most often symmetric while left-lateralized (9%) and right-lateralized (17%) atrophy were present in a minority of patients. Atrophy was more often ventral (32%) than dorsal (3%) predominant. Patients with right-lateralized atrophy were characterized by higher severity of abnormal eating behavior and hallucinations compared to those with left-lateralized atrophy. Subsequent analyses clarified that eating behavior was associated with right atrophy to a greater extent than a lack of left atrophy, and hallucinations were driven mainly by right atrophy. Dorsality analyses showed that anxiety, euphoria, and disinhibition correlated with ventral-predominant atrophy. Agitation, irritability, and depression showed greater severity with a lack of regional atrophy, including in dorsal regions. Aberrant motor behavior and apathy were not explained by asymmetry or dorsality. This study provides additional insight into how anatomical heterogeneity influences the clinical presentation of patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Behavioral symptoms can be associated not only with the presence or absence of focal atrophy, but also with right/left or dorsal/ventral imbalance of gray matter volume.",

Here, we define a mechanism for plasticity repair in vulnerable neurons using the C-terminus of the KIdney/BRAin (KIBRA) protein (CT-KIBRA). We show that CT-KIBRA restores plasticity and memory in transgenic mice expressing pathogenic human tau; however, CT-KIBRA did not alter tau levels or prevent tau-induced synapse loss. Instead, we find that CT-KIBRA binds to and stabilizes protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) to maintain synaptic plasticity and memory despite tau-mediated pathogenesis. In humans we find that reduced KIBRA in brain and increased KIBRA in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with cognitive impairment and pathological tau levels in disease. Thus, our results distinguish KIBRA both as a novel biomarker of synapse dysfunction in AD and as the foundation for a synapse repair mechanism to reverse cognitive impairment in tauopathy.",

            "abstract": "Prior research has revealed distinctive patterns of impaired language abilities across the three variants of Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA): nonfluent/agrammatic (nfvPPA), logopenic (lvPPA) and semantic (svPPA). However, little is known about whether, and to what extent, non-verbal cognitive abilities, such as processing speed, are impacted in PPA patients. This is because neuropsychological tests typically contain linguistic stimuli and require spoken output, being therefore sensitive to verbal deficits in aphasic patients. The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in processing speed between PPA patients and healthy controls, and among the three PPA variants, using a brief non-verbal tablet-based task (Match) modeled after the WAIS-III digit symbol coding test, and to determine its neural correlates. Here, we compared performance on the Match task between PPA patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 59) and across the three PPA variants. We correlated performance on Match with voxelwise gray and white matter volumes. We found that lvPPA and nfvPPA patients performed significantly worse on Match than healthy controls and svPPA patients. Worse performance on Match across PPA patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in specific parts of the left middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus, and reduced white matter volume in the left parietal lobe. To conclude, our behavioral findings reveal that processing speed is differentially impacted across the three PPA variants and provide support for the potential clinical utility of a tabled-based task (Match) to assess non-verbal cognition. In addition, our neuroimaging findings confirm the importance of a set of fronto-parietal regions that previous research has associated with processing speed and executive control. Finally, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings combined indicate that differences in processing speed are largely explained by the unequal distribution of atrophy in these fronto-parietal regions across the three PPA variants.",

            "abstract": "It is debated whether primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) and progressive agrammatic aphasia (PAA) belong to the same clinical spectrum traditionally termed nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) or exist as two completely distinct syndromic entities with specific pathologic/prognostic correlates. We analyzed speech, language, and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g., PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with etiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated utilizing linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS, and 6 PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by nonfluent speech, executive dysfunction, and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between FTLD neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance ([i] severity-agrammatism, [ii] prominent AOS, and [iii] prominent dysarthria). None of these data-driven LCD allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute, and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",

Previous studies suggest that Filipino Americans have one of the highest incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) among AAPI subgroups. Despite the expected increase in Filipino Americans with ADRD, no studies to-date have validated neuropsychological measures in the United States for speakers of Tagalog, a major language spoken by Filipino Americans. A significant barrier to dementia care and diagnosis is the lack of linguistically and socioculturally appropriate cognitive tasks for Tagalog speakers. To address this need, we developed and piloted the Cognitive Assessment for Tagalog Speakers (CATS), the first neuropsychological battery for the detection of ADRD in Filipino American Tagalog speakers.",

As a complement to classic tests, scalable and low-cost digital tools can capture relevant anomalies automatically, potentially supporting the quest for globally equitable markers of brain health. However, this promise remains unfulfilled due to limited linguistic diversity in scientific works and clinical instruments. Here we argue for cross-linguistic research as a core strategy to counter this problem. First, we survey the contributions of linguistic assessments in the study of primary progressive aphasia and the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders worldwide-Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Second, we address two forms of linguistic unfairness in the literature: the neglect of most of the world's 7000 languages and the preponderance of English-speaking cohorts. Third, we review studies showing that linguistic dysfunctions in a given disorder may vary depending on the patient's language and that English speakers offer a suboptimal benchmark for other language groups. Finally, we highlight different approaches, tools and initiatives for cross-linguistic research, identifying core challenges for their deployment. Overall, we seek to inspire timely actions to counter a looming source of inequity in behavioural neurology.",

Compared to other developed nations, U.S. incidence and mortality rates were exceptionally high, due in part to inconsistent policies across local, state, and federal agencies regarding preventive behaviors like mask wearing and social distancing. Furthermore, vaccine hesitancy and conspiracy theories around COVID-19 and vaccine safety have proliferated widely, making herd immunity that much more challenging. What factors of the U.S. culture have contributed to the significant impact of the pandemic? Why have we not responded better to the challenges of COVID-19? Or would many people in the U.S. claim that we have responded perfectly well? To explore these questions, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative study of Florida State University faculty, staff, and students. This study measured their perceptions of the pandemic, their behaviors tied to safety and community, and how these practices were tied to beliefs of individualism and collectivism. We found that collectivist orientations were associated with a greater likelihood of wearing masks consistently, severe interruptions of one's social life caused by the pandemic, greater concern for infecting others, and higher levels of trust in medical professionals for behavioral guidelines surrounding the pandemic. These associations largely persist even after adjusting for political affiliation, which we find is also a strong predictor of COVID-19 beliefs and behaviors.",

Different clinical syndromes have been described in relation to localized atrophy, informing on the functional networks that underlie these specific cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. These functional declines are linked with the underlying neurodegeneration of frontal and/or temporal lobes due to diverse molecular pathologies. Initially, the accumulation of misfolded proteins targets specifically susceptible cell assemblies, leading to relatively focal neurodegeneration that later spreads throughout large-scale cortical networks. Here, we discuss the most recent clinical, neuropathological, imaging, and genetics findings in FTD-spectrum syndromes affecting the temporal lobe. We focus on the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia and its mirror image, the right temporal variant of FTD. Incipient focal atrophy of the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) manifests with predominant naming, word comprehension, reading, and object semantic deficits, while cases of predominantly right ATL atrophy present with impairments of socioemotional, nonverbal semantic, and person-specific knowledge. Overall, the observations in FTD allow for crucial clinical-anatomic inferences, shedding light on the role of the temporal lobes in both cognition and complex behaviors. The concerted activity of both ATLs is critical to ensure that percepts are translated into concepts, yet important hemispheric differences should be acknowledged. On one hand, the left ATL attributes meaning to linguistic, external stimuli, thus supporting goal-oriented, action-related behaviors (e.g., integrating sounds and letters into words). On the other hand, the right ATL assigns meaning to emotional, visceral stimuli, thus guiding socially relevant behaviors (e.g., integrating body sensations into feelings of familiarity).",

However, little is known about whether, and to what extent, non-verbal cognitive abilities, such as processing speed, are impacted in PPA patients. This is because neuropsychological tests typically contain linguistic stimuli and require spoken output, being therefore sensitive to verbal deficits in aphasic patients. The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in processing speed between PPA patients and healthy controls, and among the three PPA variants, using a brief non-verbal tablet-based task (Match) modeled after the WAIS-III digit symbol coding test, and to determine its neural correlates. Here, we compared performance on the Match task between PPA patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 59) and across the three PPA variants. We correlated performance on Match with voxelwise gray and white matter volumes. We found that lvPPA and nfvPPA patients performed significantly worse on Match than healthy controls and svPPA patients. Worse performance on Match across PPA patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in specific parts of the left middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus, and reduced white matter volume in the left parietal lobe. To conclude, our behavioral findings reveal that processing speed is differentially impacted across the three PPA variants and provide support for the potential clinical utility of a tabled-based task (Match) to assess non-verbal cognition. In addition, our neuroimaging findings confirm the importance of a set of fronto-parietal regions that previous research has associated with processing speed and executive control. Finally, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings combined indicate that differences in processing speed are largely explained by the unequal distribution of atrophy in these fronto-parietal regions across the three PPA variants.",

This nexus between openness to interpersonal diversity, as an aspect of the larger personality trait of openness, and creativity has precipitated considerable scholarly interest across the disciplines of personality, social and organizational psychology, and neuroscientific investigation. In this paper, we review the neurobehavioral properties, including the cognitive processes and neural mechanisms, that connect these two constructs. Further, we explore how culture influences levels of openness and creativity in individuals and consider how creativity predisposes individuals toward openness to a plethora of experiences, including those occurring in culturally diverse contexts. This reciprocal entanglement of creativity and openness has been shown to foster a reduction in biases, augment conflict resolution capabilities, and generally yield superior outcomes in multicultural environments.",

There are two clinical variants of SD: semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe and insula in the left hemisphere, and semantic behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (sbvFTD), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in those structures in the right hemisphere. Previous studies of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, an associated clinical syndrome that targets the frontal lobes and anterior insula, have found impairments in baseline autonomic nervous system activity that correlate with left-lateralized frontotemporal atrophy patterns and disruptions in socioemotional functioning. Here, we evaluated whether there are similar impairments in resting autonomic nervous system activity in SD that also reflect left-lateralized atrophy and relate to diminished affiliative behavior. A total of 82 participants including 33 people with SD (20 svPPA and 13 sbvFTD) and 49 healthy older controls completed a laboratory-based assessment of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a parasympathetic measure) and skin conductance level (SCL; a sympathetic measure) during a two-minute resting baseline period. Participants also underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging, and informants rated their current affiliative behavior on the Interpersonal Adjective Scale. Results indicated that baseline RSA and SCL were lower in SD than in healthy controls, with significant impairments present in both svPPA and sbvFTD. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed left-greater-than-right atrophy related to diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow in SD. While left-lateralized atrophy in the mid-to-posterior insula correlated with lower RSA, left-lateralized atrophy in the ventral anterior insula correlated with lower SCL. In SD, lower baseline RSA, but not lower SCL, was associated with lower gregariousness/extraversion. Neither autonomic measure related to warmth/agreeableness, however. Through the assessment of baseline autonomic nervous system physiology, the present study contributes to expanding conceptualizations of the biological basis of socioemotional alterations in svPPA and sbvFTD.",

Square dance is a form of collaborative group dancing and while traditionally a heteronormative form of dance, gay square dance is typically open to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation. Square dancing offers opportunities to belong to a community of others engaged in the same activity, which older adults often find satisfying. The aim of this research was to understand how older adults who identify as women experience social support in the context of participating in gay square dance and the role previous experiences of social exclusion play in influencing these experiences. Fourteen self-identified women (age range 55-79 years; n = 11 White, n = 1 Black, n = 2 Jewish) belonging to a gay square dance club participated. Participants self-identified as heterosexual (n = 7), lesbian (n = 3), pansexual (n = 1), bisexual (n = 1), or did not identify with existing terminology (n = 2). Interviews were conducted during a gay square-dancing festival and thematically analyzed. Findings highlighted that participants experienced acceptance which affirmed their sense of self and enabled their authentic selves. To foster a sense of belonging and close relationships, specific actions (e.g., demonstrative welcoming of newcomers, mutual support) were taken by other participants in the group. Physical touch is an inherent part of square dancing, which took on different meanings for participants and was overall perceived as safe. Inclusive groups like gay square dance clubs are an important and consistent means where older adult women can experience meaningful social relationships and interactions.",

The results show that (1) the government increasing fines on hospitals is conducive to compliant hospital operations, and the incentive mechanism has little effect on such operations; (2) the lack of an incentive mechanism for third parties results in false investigations by third parties; and (3) rewards from higher levels of government promote strict supervision by local governments, but that the high cost of supervision and rewards for hospitals inhibits the probability of strict supervision. Finally, Matlab 2020a is used for simulation analysis to provide a reference for the government to improve the supervision of healthcare fraud.",

For this to occur, academic researchers must build mutually respectful partnerships with co-researchers by establishing trust. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our objective was to virtually assemble a group of co-researchers (people with diverse but relevant experiences of homelessness and diabetes) and academic researchers who engaged in the CBPR process to identify a project that would address the difficulties of diabetes management while experiencing homelessness. Co-researchers were recruited to the committee from community homeless-serving organizations. Six co-researchers, one peer researcher and three academic researchers from Calgary, Alberta met virtually for bi-weekly committee meetings, from June 2021 to May 2022 to explore barriers to diabetes management and to complete a priority-setting exercise to determine the focus of our collective project. After reflecting on our virtual CBPR experience we present lessons learned related to: i) technical challenges and logistical considerations, ii) meeting virtually and building rapport, iii) driving engagement, and iv) challenges of transitioning from virtual to in-person meeting format. Overall, the process of conducting a CBPR project virtually to engage a group of co-researchers during a pandemic presents its challenges. However, a virtual CBPR project is feasible and can lead to meaningful experiences that benefit all group members, both from the community and academia.",

Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.",

            "abstract": "As genetic testing has become more accessible and affordable, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are increasingly identified, and determining whether these variants play causal roles in disease is a major challenge. The known disease-associated Annexin A11 (ANXA11) mutations result in ANXA11 aggregation, alterations in lysosomal-RNA granule co-trafficking, and TDP-43 mis-localization and present as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia. We identified a novel VUS in ANXA11 (P93S) in a kindred with corticobasal syndrome and unique radiographic features that segregated with disease. We then queried neurodegenerative disorder clinic databases to identify the phenotypic spread of ANXA11 mutations. Multi-modal computational analysis of this variant was performed and the effect of this VUS on ANXA11 function and TDP-43 biology was characterized in iPSC-derived neurons. Single-cell sequencing and proteomic analysis of iPSC-derived neurons and microglia were used to determine the multiomic signature of this VUS. Mutations in ANXA11 were found in association with clinically diagnosed corticobasal syndrome, thereby establishing corticobasal syndrome as part of ANXA11 clinical spectrum. In iPSC-derived neurons expressing mutant ANXA11, we found decreased colocalization of lysosomes and decreased neuritic RNA as well as decreased nuclear TDP-43 and increased formation of cryptic exons compared to controls. Multiomic assessment of the P93S variant in iPSC-derived neurons and microglia indicates that the pathogenic omic signature in neurons is modest compared to microglia. Additionally, omic studies reveal that immune dysregulation and interferon signaling pathways in microglia are central to disease. Collectively, these findings identify a new pathogenic variant in ANXA11, expand the range of clinical syndromes caused by ANXA11 mutations, and implicate both neuronal and microglia dysfunction in ANXA11 pathophysiology. This work illustrates the potential for iPSC-derived cellular models to revolutionize the variant annotation process and provides a generalizable approach to determining causality of novel variants across genes.",

Older adults with TRD often have complicated comorbidities and several predisposing risk factors, which may lead to neuropsychiatric dysfunction and poor response to treatment. Several hypotheses suggest the underlying mechanisms, including vascular, immunological, senescence, or abnormal protein deposition. Treatment strategies for TRD include optimization of current medication dose, augmentation, switching to an alternative agent or class, and combination of different antidepressant classes, as well as nonpharmacological adjuvant interventions such as biophysical stimulation and psychotherapy. In summary, treatment recommendations for TRD in the elderly favor a multimodal approach, combining pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments.",

For early-onset AD patients without an identified autosomal dominant cause, we hypothesized that their early-onset disease reflects further enrichment of the common risk-conferring single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. We applied a previously validated polygenic hazard score for late-onset AD to 193 consecutive patients diagnosed at our tertiary dementia referral center with symptomatic early-onset AD. For comparison, we included 179 participants with late-onset AD and 70 healthy controls. Polygenic hazard scores were similar in early- versus late-onset AD. The polygenic hazard score was not associated with age-of-onset or disease biomarkers within early-onset AD. Early-onset AD does not represent an extreme enrichment of the common single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. Further exploration of novel genetic risk factors of this highly heritable disease is warranted.",

We sought to improve pathological prediction by exploring clinicopathological correlations in a large bvFTD cohort. Among 438 patients in whom bvFTD was either the top or an alternative possible clinical diagnosis, 117 had available autopsy data, including 98 with a primary pathological diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 15 with Alzheimer's disease, and four with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who lacked neurodegenerative disease-related pathology outside of the motor system. Patients with FTLD were distributed between FTLD-tau (34 patients: 10 corticobasal degeneration, nine progressive supranuclear palsy, eight Pick's disease, three frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism associated with chromosome 17, three unclassifiable tauopathy, and one argyrophilic grain disease); FTLD-TDP (55 patients: nine type A including one with motor neuron disease, 27 type B including 21 with motor neuron disease, eight type C with right temporal lobe presentations, and 11 unclassifiable including eight with motor neuron disease), FTLD-FUS (eight patients), and one patient with FTLD-ubiquitin proteasome system positive inclusions (FTLD-UPS) that stained negatively for tau, TDP-43, and FUS. Alzheimer's disease was uncommon (6%) among patients whose only top diagnosis during follow-up was bvFTD. Seventy-nine per cent of FTLD-tau, 86% of FTLD-TDP, and 88% of FTLD-FUS met at least 'possible' bvFTD diagnostic criteria at first presentation. The frequency of the six core bvFTD diagnostic features was similar in FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP, suggesting that these features alone cannot be used to separate patients by major molecular class. Voxel-based morphometry revealed that nearly all pathological subgroups and even individual patients share atrophy in anterior cingulate, frontoinsula, striatum, and amygdala, indicating that degeneration of these regions is intimately linked to the behavioural syndrome produced by these diverse aetiologies. In addition to these unifying features, symptom profiles also differed among pathological subtypes, suggesting distinct anatomical vulnerabilities and informing a clinician's prediction of pathological diagnosis. Data-driven classification into one of the 10 most common pathological diagnoses was most accurate (up to 60.2%) when using a combination of known predictive factors (genetic mutations, motor features, or striking atrophy patterns) and the results of a discriminant function analysis that incorporated clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological data.",

In a series of musical tasks, the subject was unable to accurately identify any of the perceptual components of music beyond simple pitch discrimination, including musical variables known to impact the perception of affect. The subject subsequently misidentified the musical character of personally familiar tunes presented experimentally, but continued to report that the activity of 'listening' to specific musical genres was an emotionally rewarding experience.

We analyzed speech, language, and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g., PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with etiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated utilizing linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS, and 6 PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by nonfluent speech, executive dysfunction, and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between FTLD neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance ([i] severity-agrammatism, [ii] prominent AOS, and [iii] prominent dysarthria). None of these data-driven LCD allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute, and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",

Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.",

Here, we investigate proteasome function and localization at synapses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) post-mortem brain tissue and in experimental models. We found a marked increase in ubiquitinylated proteins in post-mortem AD hippocampi compared to controls. Using several experimental models, we show that amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs) inhibit synaptic proteasome activity and trigger a reduction in synaptic proteasome content. We further show proteasome inhibition specifically in hippocampal synaptic fractions derived from APPswePS1ΔE9 mice. Reduced synaptic proteasome activity instigated by AβOs is corrected by treatment with rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, in mice. Results further show that dynein inhibition blocks AβO-induced reduction in dendritic proteasome content in hippocampal neurons. Finally, proteasome inhibition induces AD-like pathological features, including reactive oxygen species and dendritic spine loss in hippocampal neurons, inhibition of hippocampal mRNA translation, and memory impairment in mice. Results suggest that proteasome inhibition may contribute to synaptic and memory deficits in AD.",

While the U-fibers play a crucial role in various brain disorders, there is a lack of effective tools to reconstruct their highly curved trajectory from diffusion MRI (dMRI). In this work, we propose a novel surface-based framework for the probabilistic tracking of fibers on the triangular mesh representation of the SWM. By deriving a closed-form solution to transform the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients of 3D fiber orientation distributions (FODs) to local coordinate systems on each triangle, we develop a novel approach to project the FODs onto the tangent space of the SWM. After that, we utilize parallel transport to realize the intrinsic propagation of streamlines on SWM following probabilistically sampled fiber directions. Our intrinsic and surface-based method eliminates the need to perform the necessary but challenging sharp turns in 3D compared with conventional volume-based tractography methods. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we performed quantitative comparisons to demonstrate the proposed algorithm can more effectively reconstruct the U-fibers connecting the precentral and postcentral gyrus than previous methods. Quantitative validations were then performed on post-mortem MRIs to show the reconstructed U-fibers from our method more faithfully follow the SWM than volume-based tractography. Finally, we applied our algorithm to study the parietal U-fiber connectivity changes in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) patients and successfully detected significant associations between U-fiber connectivity and disease severity.",

Challenges to the rational design of effective antibodies include the difficulty of achieving specific affinity to critical targets, poor expression, and antibody aggregation caused by buried charges and unstructured loops. To overcome these challenges, we grafted previously determined sequences of fibril-capping amyloid inhibitors onto a camel heavy chain antibody scaffold. These sequences were designed to cap fibrils of tau, known to form the neurofibrillary tangles of AD, thereby preventing fibril elongation. The nanobodies grafted with capping inhibitors blocked tau aggregation in biosensor cells seeded with postmortem brain extracts from AD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. The tau capping nanobody inhibitors also blocked seeding by recombinant tau oligomers. Another challenge to the design of effective antibodies is their poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. In this study, we also designed a bispecific nanobody composed of a nanobody that targets a receptor on the BBB and a tau capping nanobody inhibitor, conjoined by a flexible linker. We provide evidence that the bispecific nanobody improved BBB penetration over the tau capping inhibitor alone after intravenous administration in mice. Our results suggest that the design of synthetic antibodies that target sequences that drive protein aggregation may be a promising approach to inhibit the prion-like seeding of tau and other proteins involved in AD and related proteinopathies.",

            "abstract": "The nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome primarily defined by the presence of apraxia of speech (AoS) and/or expressive agrammatism. In addition, many patients exhibit dysarthria and/or receptive agrammatism. This leads to substantial phenotypic variation within the speech-language domain across individuals and time, in terms of both the specific combination of symptoms as well as their severity. How to resolve such phenotypic heterogeneity in nfvPPA is a matter of debate. \"Splitting\" views propose separate clinical entities: \"primary progressive apraxia of speech\" (PPAOS) when AoS occurs in the absence of expressive agrammatism, \"progressive agrammatic aphasia\" (PAA) in the opposite case, and \"AOS + PAA\" when mixed motor speech and language symptoms are clearly present. While therapeutic interventions typically vary depending on the predominant symptom (e.g., AoS vs expressive agrammatism), the existence of behavioral, anatomical, and pathological overlap across these phenotypes argues against drawing such clear-cut boundaries. In the current study, we contribute to this debate by mapping behavior to brain in a large, prospective cohort of well-characterized patients with nfvPPA (n = 104). We sought to advance scientific understanding of nfvPPA and the neural basis of speech-language by uncovering where in the brain the degree of MRI-based atrophy is associated with inter-patient variability in the presence and severity of AoS, dysarthria, expressive agrammatism, or receptive agrammatism. Our cross-sectional examination of brain-behavior relationships revealed three main observations. First, we found that the neural correlates of AoS and expressive agrammatism in nfvPPA lie side by side in the left posterior inferior frontal lobe, explaining their behavioral dissociation/association in previous reports. Second, we identified a \"left-right\" and \"ventral-dorsal\" neuroanatomical distinction between AoS versus dysarthria, highlighting (i) that dysarthria, but not AoS, is significantly influenced by tissue loss in right-hemisphere motor-speech regions and (ii) that, within the left hemisphere, dysarthria and AoS map onto dorsally versus ventrally located motor-speech regions, respectively. Third, we confirmed that, within the large-scale grammar network, left frontal tissue loss is preferentially involved in expressive agrammatism and left temporal tissue loss in receptive agrammatism. Our findings thus contribute to define the function and location of the epicenters within the large-scale neural networks vulnerable to neurodegenerative changes in nfvPPA. We propose that nfvPPA be redefined as an umbrella term subsuming a spectrum of speech and/or language phenotypes that are closely linked by the underlying neuroanatomy and neuropathology.",

Understanding how the brain coordinates neural activity with sleep onset can provide insights into the physiological functions subserved by sleep and the pathologic phenomena associated with sleep onset. We quantified whole-brain network changes in synchrony and information flow during the transition from wakefulness to light non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, using MEG imaging in a convenient sample of 14 healthy human participants (11 female; mean 63.4 years [SD 11.8 years]). We furthermore performed computational modeling to infer excitatory and inhibitory properties of local neural activity. The transition from wakefulness to light NREM was identified to be encoded in spatially and temporally specific patterns of long-range synchrony. Within the delta band, there was a global increase in connectivity from wakefulness to light NREM, which was highest in frontoparietal regions. Within the theta band, there was an increase in connectivity in fronto-parieto-occipital regions and a decrease in temporal regions from wakefulness to Stage 1 sleep. Patterns of information flow revealed that mesial frontal regions receive hierarchically organized inputs from broad cortical regions upon sleep onset, including direct inflow from occipital regions and indirect inflow via parieto-temporal regions within the delta frequency band. Finally, biophysical neural mass modeling demonstrated changes in the anterior-to-posterior distribution of cortical excitation-to-inhibition with increased excitation-to-inhibition model parameters in anterior regions in light NREM compared with wakefulness. Together, these findings uncover whole-brain corticocortical structure and the orchestration of local and long-range, frequency-specific cortical interactions in the sleep-wake transition.",

While many studies have investigated static functional connectivity, it has been unclear whether features of dynamic functional connectivity are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Popular sliding-window and clustering methods for extracting dynamic RSFC have various limitations that prevent extracting reliable features to address this question. Here, we use a novel and robust time-varying dynamic network (TVDN) approach to extract the dynamic RSFC features from high resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and matched controls. The TVDN algorithm automatically and adaptively learns the low-dimensional spatiotemporal manifold of dynamic RSFC and detects dynamic state transitions in data. We show that amongst all the functional features we investigated, the dynamic manifold features are the most predictive of AD. These include: the temporal complexity of the brain network, given by the number of state transitions and their dwell times, and the spatial complexity of the brain network, given by the number of eigenmodes. These dynamic features have higher sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing AD from healthy subjects than the existing benchmarks do. Intriguingly, we found that AD patients generally have higher spatial complexity but lower temporal complexity compared with healthy controls. We also show that graph theoretic metrics of dynamic component of TVDN are significantly different in AD versus controls, while static graph metrics are not statistically different. These results indicate that dynamic RSFC features are impacted in neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease, and may be crucial to understanding the pathophysiological trajectory of these diseases.",

Here, we examine how AD affects the fidelity of auditory feedback predictions during speaking. We focus on the phenomenon of speaking-induced suppression (SIS), the auditory cortical responses' suppression during auditory feedback processing. SIS is determined by subtracting the magnitude of auditory cortical responses during speaking from listening to playback of the same speech. Our state feedback control (SFC) model of speech motor control explains SIS as arising from the onset of auditory feedback matching a prediction of that feedback onset during speaking, a prediction that is absent during passive listening to playback of the auditory feedback. Our model hypothesizes that the auditory cortical response to auditory feedback reflects the mismatch with the prediction: small during speaking, large during listening, with the difference being SIS. Normally, during speaking, auditory feedback matches its predictions, then SIS will be large. Any reductions in SIS will indicate inaccuracy in auditory feedback prediction not matching the actual feedback. We investigated SIS in AD patients [",

While neuroimaging studies have revealed functional abnormalities in AD, how these relate to aberrant neuronal circuit mechanisms remains unclear. Using magnetoencephalography imaging we documented abnormal local neural synchrony patterns in patients with AD. To identify abnormal biophysical mechanisms underlying these abnormal electrophysiological patterns, we estimated the parameters of a spectral graph-theory model (SGM). SGM is an analytic model that describes how long-range fiber projections in the brain mediate the excitatory and inhibitory activity of local neuronal subpopulations. The long-range excitatory time scale was associated with greater deficits in global cognition and was able to distinguish AD patients from controls with high accuracy. These results demonstrate that long-range excitatory time scale of neuronal activity, despite being a global measure, is a key determinant in the spatiospectral signatures and cognition in AD.",

SEA has been demonstrated to be common in AD, with prevalence estimates ranging between 22-54%. Converging lines of basic and clinical evidence imply that modifying a hyperexcitable state results in an improvement in cognition. In particular, though these results require further confirmation, post-hoc findings from a recent phase II clinical trial suggest a therapeutic effect with levetiracetam administration in patients with AD and IEDs. Here, we review key unanswered questions as well as potential clinical trial avenues. Specifically, we discuss postulated mechanisms and treatment of hyperexcitability in patients with AD, which are of interest in designing future disease-modifying therapies.

Resting-state magnetoencephalography was obtained in 31 participants with subsequent responsive neurostimulation device implantation between 15 August 2014 and 1 October 2020. Functional connectivity was computed across multiple spatial scales (global, hemispheric, and lobar) using pre-implantation magnetoencephalography and normalized to maps of healthy controls. Normalized functional connectivity was investigated as a predictor of clinical response, defined as percent change in self-reported seizure frequency in the most recent year of clinic visits relative to pre-responsive neurostimulation baseline. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve quantified the performance of functional connectivity in predicting responders (≥50% reduction in seizure frequency) and non-responders (<50%). Leave-one-out cross-validation was furthermore performed to characterize model performance. The relationship between seizure frequency reduction and frequency-specific functional connectivity was further assessed as a continuous measure. Across participants, stimulation was enabled for a median duration of 52.2 (interquartile range, 27.0-62.3) months.

Due to failures in their control, there is an urgent need for more efficient and environmentally friendly monitoring and control tools. These hematophagous insects rely heavily on chemical information from the environment to detect hosts and cues/signals from conspecifics. Chemical ecology includes the elucidation of the functional role of chemicals mediating interactions between organisms. Studies on the chemical ecology of triatomines are leading to novel methods for their monitor and control. Thus, laboratory tests to develop chemical attractants and repellents are promissory and have led to the design of, for example, efficient baited traps. However, the monitoring and control tools proposed until now have not been as effective in the field.",

We aimed to characterize feasibility, clinical, and biomarker effects of noninvasive neurostimulation for aMCI. 13 individuals with aMCI received eight 60-minute sessions of 40-Hz (gamma) transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) targeting regions related to episodic memory processing. Feasibility, episodic memory, and plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers were assessed. Neuroplastic changes were characterized by resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance. Gamma tACS was feasible and aMCI participants demonstrated improvement in multiple metrics of episodic memory, but no changes in biomarkers. Improvements in episodic memory were most pronounced in participants who had the highest modeled tACS-induced electric fields and exhibited the greatest changes in RSFC. Increased RSFC was also associated with greater hippocampal excitability and higher baseline white matter integrity. This study highlights initial feasibility and the potential of gamma tACS to rescue episodic memory in an aMCI population by modulating connectivity and excitability within an episodic memory network.",

For early-onset AD patients without an identified autosomal dominant cause, we hypothesized that their early-onset disease reflects further enrichment of the common risk-conferring single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. We applied a previously validated polygenic hazard score for late-onset AD to 193 consecutive patients diagnosed at our tertiary dementia referral center with symptomatic early-onset AD. For comparison, we included 179 participants with late-onset AD and 70 healthy controls. Polygenic hazard scores were similar in early- versus late-onset AD. The polygenic hazard score was not associated with age-of-onset or disease biomarkers within early-onset AD. Early-onset AD does not represent an extreme enrichment of the common single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. Further exploration of novel genetic risk factors of this highly heritable disease is warranted.",

At diagnosis, up to 25% of people with MND (pwMND) exhibit bulbar dysfunction. Currently, pwMND are assessed using clinical examination and diagnostic tools including the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALS-FRS(R)), a clinician-administered questionnaire with a single item on speech intelligibility. Here we report on the use of digital technologies to assess speech features as a marker of disease diagnosis and progression in pwMND. Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline and EMBASE were systematically searched. 40 studies were evaluated including 3670 participants; 1878 with a diagnosis of MND. 24 studies used microphones, 5 used smartphones, 6 used apps, 2 used tape recorders and 1 used the Multi-Dimensional Voice Programme (MDVP) to record speech samples. Data extraction and analysis methods varied but included traditional statistical analysis, CSpeech, MATLAB and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Speech features assessed also varied and included jitter, shimmer, fundamental frequency, intelligible speaking rate, pause duration and syllable repetition. Findings from this systematic review indicate that digital speech biomarkers can distinguish pwMND from healthy controls and can help identify bulbar involvement in pwMND. Preliminary evidence suggests digitally assessed acoustic features can identify more nuanced changes in those affected by voice dysfunction. No one digital speech biomarker alone is consistently able to diagnose or prognosticate MND. Further longitudinal studies involving larger samples are required to validate the use of these technologies as diagnostic tools or prognostic biomarkers.",

There are two clinical variants of SD: semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe and insula in the left hemisphere, and semantic behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (sbvFTD), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in those structures in the right hemisphere. Previous studies of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, an associated clinical syndrome that targets the frontal lobes and anterior insula, have found impairments in baseline autonomic nervous system activity that correlate with left-lateralized frontotemporal atrophy patterns and disruptions in socioemotional functioning. Here, we evaluated whether there are similar impairments in resting autonomic nervous system activity in SD that also reflect left-lateralized atrophy and relate to diminished affiliative behavior. A total of 82 participants including 33 people with SD (20 svPPA and 13 sbvFTD) and 49 healthy older controls completed a laboratory-based assessment of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a parasympathetic measure) and skin conductance level (SCL; a sympathetic measure) during a two-minute resting baseline period. Participants also underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging, and informants rated their current affiliative behavior on the Interpersonal Adjective Scale. Results indicated that baseline RSA and SCL were lower in SD than in healthy controls, with significant impairments present in both svPPA and sbvFTD. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed left-greater-than-right atrophy related to diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow in SD. While left-lateralized atrophy in the mid-to-posterior insula correlated with lower RSA, left-lateralized atrophy in the ventral anterior insula correlated with lower SCL. In SD, lower baseline RSA, but not lower SCL, was associated with lower gregariousness/extraversion. Neither autonomic measure related to warmth/agreeableness, however. Through the assessment of baseline autonomic nervous system physiology, the present study contributes to expanding conceptualizations of the biological basis of socioemotional alterations in svPPA and sbvFTD.",

Little is known about how these structural imbalances impact clinical symptomatology. The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of frontotemporal asymmetry (right- or left-lateralization) and dorsality (ventral or dorsal predominance of atrophy) and to investigate their clinical correlates. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and structural images were analyzed for 250 patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal atrophy was most often symmetric while left-lateralized (9%) and right-lateralized (17%) atrophy were present in a minority of patients. Atrophy was more often ventral (32%) than dorsal (3%) predominant. Patients with right-lateralized atrophy were characterized by higher severity of abnormal eating behavior and hallucinations compared to those with left-lateralized atrophy. Subsequent analyses clarified that eating behavior was associated with right atrophy to a greater extent than a lack of left atrophy, and hallucinations were driven mainly by right atrophy. Dorsality analyses showed that anxiety, euphoria, and disinhibition correlated with ventral-predominant atrophy. Agitation, irritability, and depression showed greater severity with a lack of regional atrophy, including in dorsal regions. Aberrant motor behavior and apathy were not explained by asymmetry or dorsality. This study provides additional insight into how anatomical heterogeneity influences the clinical presentation of patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Behavioral symptoms can be associated not only with the presence or absence of focal atrophy, but also with right/left or dorsal/ventral imbalance of gray matter volume.",

            "abstract": "Patients with neurodegenerative disorders experience a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The neural correlates have been explored for many individual symptoms, such as apathy and disinhibition. Atrophy patterns have also been associated with broadly recognized syndromes that bring together multiple symptoms, such as the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia. There is substantial heterogeneity of symptoms, with partial overlap of behaviour and affected neuroanatomy across and within dementia subtypes. It is not well established if there are anatomically distinct behavioural subphenotypes in neurodegenerative disease. The objective of this study was to identify shared behavioural profiles in frontotemporal dementia-spectrum and Alzheimer's disease-related syndromes. Additionally, we sought to determine the underlying neural correlates of these symptom clusters. Two hundred and eighty-one patients diagnosed with one of seven different dementia syndromes, in addition to healthy controls and individuals with mild cognitive impairment, completed a 109-item assessment capturing the severity of a range of clinical behaviours. A principal component analysis captured distinct clusters of related behaviours. Voxel-based morphometry analyses were used to identify regions of volume loss associated with each component. Seven components were identified and interpreted as capturing the following behaviours: Component 1-emotional bluntness, 2-emotional lability and disinhibition, 3-neuroticism, 4-rigidity and impatience, 5-indiscriminate consumption, 6-psychosis and 7-Geschwind syndrome-related behaviours. Correlations with structural brain volume revealed distinct neuroanatomical patterns associated with each component, including after controlling for diagnosis, suggesting that localized neurodegeneration can lead to the development of behavioural symptom clusters across various dementia syndromes.",

The current gold-standard measure of progression is the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALS-FRS(R)), a clinician-administered questionnaire providing a composite score on physical functioning. Technology offers a potential alternative for assessing motor progression in both a clinical and research capacity that is more sensitive to detecting smaller changes in function. We reviewed studies evaluating the utility and suitability of these devices to evaluate motor function and disease progression in people with MND (pwMND). We systematically searched Google Scholar, PubMed and EMBASE applying no language or date restrictions. We extracted information on devices used and additional assessments undertaken. Twenty studies, involving 1275 (median 28 and ranging 6-584) pwMND, were included. Sensor type included accelerometers (n = 9), activity monitors (n = 4), smartphone apps (n = 4), gait (n = 3), kinetic sensors (n = 3), electrical impedance myography (n = 1) and dynamometers (n = 2). Seventeen (85%) of studies used the ALS-FRS(R) to evaluate concurrent validity. Participant feedback on device utility was generally positive, where evaluated in 25% of studies. All studies showed initial feasibility, warranting larger longitudinal studies to compare device sensitivity and validity beyond ALS-FRS(R). Risk of bias in the included studies was high, with a large amount of information to determine study quality unclear. Measurement of motor pathology and progression using technology is an emerging, and promising, area of MND research. Further well-powered longitudinal validation studies are needed.",

We analyzed speech, language, and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g., PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with etiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated utilizing linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS, and 6 PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by nonfluent speech, executive dysfunction, and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between FTLD neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance ([i] severity-agrammatism, [ii] prominent AOS, and [iii] prominent dysarthria). None of these data-driven LCD allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute, and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",

Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.",

Biomarkers of the target pathologies, including amyloid and tau PET, and insights from past trials were also critical to the recent successes. Moving forward, the challenge will be to develop more efficacious therapies with greater efficiency. Novel trial designs, including combination therapies and umbrella and basket protocols, will accelerate clinical development.

The goal of this summit was to connect basic scientists, clinical researchers, drug developers, and individuals affected by C9ORF72-FTD/ALS to evaluate how collaborative efforts across the FTD-ALS disease spectrum might break down existing disease silos. Presentations and discussions covered recent discoveries in C9ORF72-FTD/ALS disease mechanisms, availability of disease biomarkers and recent advances in therapeutic development, and clinical trial design for prevention and treatment for individuals affected by C9ORF72-FTD/ALS and asymptomatic pathological expansion carriers. The C9ORF72-associated hexanucleotide repeat expansion is an important locus for both ALS and FTD. C9ORF72-FTD/ALS may be characterized by loss of function of the C9ORF72 protein and toxic gain of functions caused by both dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins and hexanucleotide repeat RNA. C9ORF72-FTD/ALS therapeutic strategies discussed at the summit included the use of antisense oligonucleotides, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene silencing and gene delivery, and engineered small molecules targeting RNA structures associated with the C9ORF72 expansion. Neurofilament light chain, DPR proteins, and transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-associated molecular changes were presented as biomarker candidates. Similarly, brain imaging modalities (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and positron emission tomography [PET]) measuring structural, functional, and metabolic changes were discussed as important tools to monitor individuals affected with C9ORF72-FTD/ALS, at both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic disease stages. Finally, summit attendees evaluated current clinical trial designs available for FTD or ALS patients and concluded that therapeutics relevant to FTD/ALS patients, such as those specifically targeting C9ORF72, may need to be tested with composite endpoints covering clinical symptoms of both FTD and ALS. The latter will require novel clinical trial designs to be inclusive of all patient subgroups spanning the FTD/ALS spectrum.",

            "abstract": "The nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome primarily defined by the presence of apraxia of speech (AoS) and/or expressive agrammatism. In addition, many patients exhibit dysarthria and/or receptive agrammatism. This leads to substantial phenotypic variation within the speech-language domain across individuals and time, in terms of both the specific combination of symptoms as well as their severity. How to resolve such phenotypic heterogeneity in nfvPPA is a matter of debate. \"Splitting\" views propose separate clinical entities: \"primary progressive apraxia of speech\" (PPAOS) when AoS occurs in the absence of expressive agrammatism, \"progressive agrammatic aphasia\" (PAA) in the opposite case, and \"AOS + PAA\" when mixed motor speech and language symptoms are clearly present. While therapeutic interventions typically vary depending on the predominant symptom (e.g., AoS vs expressive agrammatism), the existence of behavioral, anatomical, and pathological overlap across these phenotypes argues against drawing such clear-cut boundaries. In the current study, we contribute to this debate by mapping behavior to brain in a large, prospective cohort of well-characterized patients with nfvPPA (n = 104). We sought to advance scientific understanding of nfvPPA and the neural basis of speech-language by uncovering where in the brain the degree of MRI-based atrophy is associated with inter-patient variability in the presence and severity of AoS, dysarthria, expressive agrammatism, or receptive agrammatism. Our cross-sectional examination of brain-behavior relationships revealed three main observations. First, we found that the neural correlates of AoS and expressive agrammatism in nfvPPA lie side by side in the left posterior inferior frontal lobe, explaining their behavioral dissociation/association in previous reports. Second, we identified a \"left-right\" and \"ventral-dorsal\" neuroanatomical distinction between AoS versus dysarthria, highlighting (i) that dysarthria, but not AoS, is significantly influenced by tissue loss in right-hemisphere motor-speech regions and (ii) that, within the left hemisphere, dysarthria and AoS map onto dorsally versus ventrally located motor-speech regions, respectively. Third, we confirmed that, within the large-scale grammar network, left frontal tissue loss is preferentially involved in expressive agrammatism and left temporal tissue loss in receptive agrammatism. Our findings thus contribute to define the function and location of the epicenters within the large-scale neural networks vulnerable to neurodegenerative changes in nfvPPA. We propose that nfvPPA be redefined as an umbrella term subsuming a spectrum of speech and/or language phenotypes that are closely linked by the underlying neuroanatomy and neuropathology.",

We developed multimodal models for f-FTD disease progression and estimated clinical trial sample sizes in C9orf72, GRN and MAPT mutation carriers. Models included longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological scores, regional brain volumes and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) in 796 carriers and 412 noncarrier controls. We found that the temporal ordering of clinical and biomarker progression differed by genotype. In prevention-trial simulations using model-based patient selection, atrophy and NfL were the best endpoints, whereas clinical measures were potential endpoints in early symptomatic trials. f-FTD prevention trials are feasible but will likely require global recruitment efforts. These disease progression models will facilitate the planning of f-FTD clinical trials, including the selection of optimal endpoints and enrollment criteria to maximize power to detect treatment effects.",

            "abstract": "Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) measurement has long been considered the gold standard of vascular assessment for people with lower limb ulceration. Despite this, only around 15% of patients in the United Kingdom who require an ABPI measurement undergo the assessment. The Lanarkshire Oximetry Index (LOI) is a cheaper and arguably more accessible approach to vascular assessment and was initially proposed as an alternative to the ABPI in 2000. No synthesis of evidence related to the LOI has been performed since its introduction into the literature. Primary studies were sought to determine the clinimetric properties of the LOI and its level of agreement with ABPI assessments. Systematic searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, BNI, ProQuest Health and Medicine, Science Direct, Google Scholar and the British Library (online search) were conducted. Reference lists of identified studies were also reviewed to identify additional studies. Three primary studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting data from 307 patients and 584 limbs assessed using both the LOI and ABPI. All three studies reported fair to moderate kappa values for interrater reliability (κ = 0.290-0.747) and statistically significant positive correlation coefficients (r = 0.37, p < 0.001 in two studies) between the LOI and ABPI. The combined data from the three studies indicated a sensitivity of 52% (41.78-62.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]) and specificity of 96.08% (93.4-97.9, 95% CI) for the LOI using the ABPI as a reference. Additional data are required to indicate the safety of the LOI in practice. Data are also required to determine if the LOI is more acceptable to clinicians compared to the ABPI and whether there are any barriers/enablers to its implementation in practice. Given the relatively low specificity of the LOI, it may be beneficial to combine measurement of the LOI with a subjective clinical risk assessment tool to improve the sensitivity of this alternative approach to vascular assessment.",

Incidences of skin tears are noted to be significant mostly in the elderly population and those with fragile and vulnerable skin. Individuals undergoing mammography are susceptible to skin tears due to factors associated with skin breakdown such as thinning of the epidermis, use of steroids, presence of moisture, but this, when compounded with the procedure of mammography can increase the risk further. Mammography, an x-ray imaging method, which exerts adequate compression force on the breast tissue for the mammographer to obtain a high-quality image for diagnostic purposes. However, when compression force is applied during mammography resulting incidences of cutaneous skin tears can occur. Lack of and under reporting of skin tears during mammography makes it difficult to ascertain the extent of this problem and scale of its incidence. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative review is to focus on providing an overview of skin tears associated with mammography and a discussion of the current literature with regards to its incidence and diagnosis. In addition, the review will also discuss the theoretical and contextual perspective of the prevention and management strategies associated with skin tears.",

We found that care homes provided students with many opportunities for interprofessional working and learning. Through better understanding the dimensions of different perspectives and approaches, students improved their education and transformed their perceptions of aged care. Having a diverse range of professionals allowed staff to gain insight into the latest evidence-based practice and address the multiple needs of the residents more holistically. Residents gained an enriched sense of meaning and purpose in their daily life by engaging in fulfilling and meaningful activities. The complexities of undertaking an IPE initiative in this setting are also considered and we conclude by proposing important avenues for future research.",

However, with both the increasing prevalence and clinical acuity of patients with wounds in the UK, it is essential that alongside innovation such as harnessing cutting-edge new technologies, frugal innovation is also pursued. This may improve both economic efficiency and patient outcomes. Frugal innovations were adopted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and included opportunistic solutions such as video-conferencing services to run clinics. However, there are many more opportunities for frugal innovation in wound care, including the use of smartphone technology, which is already accessible to 99.5% of UK clinicians caring for wounds, or the simplification of wound-assessment processes using pulse oximeters as an alternative to dopplers, as in the Lanarkshire Oximetry Index. This article explores what frugal innovation is and how it could improve UK wound services. The authors invite clinicians working in wound care to consider their access to existing resources that may not be considered useful for wound-care processes and explore how these could be used to improve clinical outcomes.",

We applied a previously validated polygenic hazard score for late-onset AD to 193 consecutive patients diagnosed at our tertiary dementia referral center with symptomatic early-onset AD. For comparison, we included 179 participants with late-onset AD and 70 healthy controls. Polygenic hazard scores were similar in early- versus late-onset AD. The polygenic hazard score was not associated with age-of-onset or disease biomarkers within early-onset AD. Early-onset AD does not represent an extreme enrichment of the common single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD.

We report a patient presenting with a logopenic syndrome due to a strategic lesion located in the superior and middle temporal gyrus and compare our findings with those of a PiB-PET positive lv-PPA patient matched by age, gender, and education. We consider that our study provides new anatomical clues to better understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the logopenic syndrome.",

            "abstract": "Prior research has revealed distinctive patterns of impaired language abilities across the three variants of Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA): nonfluent/agrammatic (nfvPPA), logopenic (lvPPA) and semantic (svPPA). However, little is known about whether, and to what extent, non-verbal cognitive abilities, such as processing speed, are impacted in PPA patients. This is because neuropsychological tests typically contain linguistic stimuli and require spoken output, being therefore sensitive to verbal deficits in aphasic patients. The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in processing speed between PPA patients and healthy controls, and among the three PPA variants, using a brief non-verbal tablet-based task (Match) modeled after the WAIS-III digit symbol coding test, and to determine its neural correlates. Here, we compared performance on the Match task between PPA patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 59) and across the three PPA variants. We correlated performance on Match with voxelwise gray and white matter volumes. We found that lvPPA and nfvPPA patients performed significantly worse on Match than healthy controls and svPPA patients. Worse performance on Match across PPA patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in specific parts of the left middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus, and reduced white matter volume in the left parietal lobe. To conclude, our behavioral findings reveal that processing speed is differentially impacted across the three PPA variants and provide support for the potential clinical utility of a tabled-based task (Match) to assess non-verbal cognition. In addition, our neuroimaging findings confirm the importance of a set of fronto-parietal regions that previous research has associated with processing speed and executive control. Finally, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings combined indicate that differences in processing speed are largely explained by the unequal distribution of atrophy in these fronto-parietal regions across the three PPA variants.",

Previous research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) presents limitations in assessing combined sources of inequity and outcomes (i.e., cognition and functionality). In this study, we assessed how social determinants of health (SDH), cardiometabolic factors (CMFs), and other medical/social factors predict cognition and functionality in an aging Colombian population. We ran a cross-sectional study that combined theory- (structural equation models) and data-driven (machine learning) approaches in a population-based study (N = 23,694; M = 69.8 years) to assess the best predictors of cognition and functionality. We found that a combination of SDH and CMF accurately predicted cognition and functionality, although SDH was the stronger predictor. Cognition was predicted with the highest accuracy by SDH, followed by demographics, CMF, and other factors. A combination of SDH, age, CMF, and additional physical/psychological factors were the best predictors of functional status. Results highlight the role of inequity in predicting brain health and advancing solutions to reduce the cognitive and functional decline in LMICs.",

            "abstract": "Progranulin is an evolutionarily conserved protein that has been implicated in human neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Human progranulin is comprised of multiple cysteine-rich, biologically active granulin peptides. Granulin peptides accumulate with age and stress, however their functional contributions relative to full-length progranulin remain unclear. To address this, we generated C. elegans strains that produced quantifiable levels of both full-length progranulin/PGRN-1 protein and cleaved granulin peptide. Using these strains, we demonstrated that even in the presence of intact PGRN-1, granulin peptides suppressed the activity of the lysosomal aspartyl protease activity, ASP-3/CTSD. Granulin peptides were also dominant over PGRN-1 in compromising animal fitness as measured by progress through development and stress response. Finally, the degradation of human TDP-43 was impaired when the granulin to PGRN-1 ratio was increased, representing a disease-relevant downstream impact of impaired lysosomal function. In summary, these studies suggest that not only absolute progranulin levels, but also the balance between full-length progranulin and its cleavage products, is important in regulating lysosomal biology. Given its relevance in human disease, this suggests that the processing of progranulin into granulins should be considered as part of disease pathobiology and may represent a site of therapeutic intervention.",

While a subset of α-synuclein, TDP-43 and tau mutations has been shown to increase the structural propensity of these proteins toward self-association, rates of aggregation are also highly dependent on protein steady state concentrations, which are in large part regulated by their rates of lysosomal degradation. Previous studies have shown that lysosomal proteases operate precisely and not indiscriminately, cleaving their substrates at very specific linear amino acid sequences. With this knowledge, we hypothesized that certain coding mutations in α-synuclein, TDP-43 and tau may lead to increased protein steady state concentrations and eventual aggregation by an alternative mechanism, that is, through disrupting lysosomal protease cleavage recognition motifs and subsequently conferring protease resistance to these proteins.",

The syndrome is caused by pathogenic variants in TSC1 (coding for hamartin) or TSC2 (coding for tuberin). Recently, we reported a progressive frontotemporal dementia-like clinical syndrome in a patient with a mutation in TSC1, but the neuropathological changes seen in adults with TSC with or without dementia have yet to be systematically explored. Here, we examined neuropathological findings in adults with TSC (n = 11) aged 30-58 years and compared them to age-matched patients with epilepsy unrelated to TSC (n = 9) and non-neurological controls (n = 10). In 3 of 11 subjects with TSC, we observed a neurofibrillary tangle-predominant \"TSC tauopathy\" not seen in epilepsy or non-neurological controls. This tauopathy was observed in the absence of pathological amyloid beta, TDP-43, or alpha-synuclein deposition. The neurofibrillary tangles in TSC tauopathy showed a unique pattern of post-translational modifications, with apparent differences between TSC1 and TSC2 mutation carriers. Tau acetylation (K274, K343) was prominent in both TSC1 and TSC2, whereas tau phosphorylation at a common phospho-epitope (S202) was observed only in TSC2. TSC tauopathy was observed in selected neocortical, limbic, subcortical, and brainstem sites and showed a 3-repeat greater than 4-repeat tau isoform pattern in both TSC1 and TSC2 mutation carriers, but no tangles were immunolabeled with MC1 or p62 antibodies. The findings suggest that individuals with TSC are at risk for a unique tauopathy in mid-life and that tauopathy pathogenesis may involve TSC1, TSC2, and related molecular pathways.",

Human dermal fibroblasts have been a major source of cells for reprogramming and differentiating into specific cell types for disease modeling. Postmortem human dura mater has been suggested as a primary source of fibroblasts for in vitro modeling of neurodegenerative diseases. Although fibroblast-like cells from human and mouse dura mater have been previously described, their utility for reprogramming and direct differentiation protocols has not been fully established. In this study, cells derived from postmortem dura mater are directly compared to those from dermal biopsies of living subjects. In two instances, we have isolated and compared dermal and dural cell lines from the same subject. Notably, striking differences were observed between cells of dermal and dural origin. Compared to dermal fibroblasts, postmortem dura mater-derived cells demonstrated different morphology, slower growth rates, and a higher rate of karyotype abnormality. Dura mater-derived cells also failed to express fibroblast protein markers. When dermal fibroblasts and dura mater-derived cells from the same subject were compared, they exhibited highly divergent gene expression profiles that suggest dura mater cells originated from a mixed mural lineage. Given their postmortem origin, somatic mutation signatures of dura mater-derived cells were assessed and suggest defective DNA damage repair. This study argues for rigorous karyotyping of postmortem derived cell lines and highlights limitations of postmortem human dura mater-derived cells for modeling normal biology or disease-associated pathobiology.",

A highly acidic pH is required for the optimal functioning of lysosomal enzymes. Loss of lysosomal intralumenal acidity can disrupt cellular protein homeostasis and is linked to age-related diseases such as neurodegeneration. Using a new robust lysosomal pH biosensor (FIRE-pHLy), we developed a cell-based fluorescence assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) and applied it to differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The goal of this study was twofold: (1) to screen for small molecules that acidify lysosomal pH and (2) to identify molecular targets and pathways that regulate lysosomal pH. We conducted a screen of 1835 bioactive compounds with annotated target information to identify lysosomal pH modulators (both acidifiers and alkalinizers). Forty-five compounds passed the initial hit selection criteria, using a combined analysis approach of population-based and object-based data. Twenty-three compounds were retested in dose-response assays and two compounds, OSI-027 and PP242, were identified as top acidifying hits. Overall, data from this phenotypic HTS screen may be used to explore novel regulatory pathways of lysosomal pH regulation. Additionally, OSI-027 and PP242 may serve as useful tool compounds to enable mechanistic studies of autophagy activation and lysosomal acidification as potential therapeutic pathways for neurodegenerative diseases.",

The explosion of information on potential and observed PTMs on tau provides an opportunity to better understand these modifications in the context of tau homeostasis, which becomes perturbed with aging and disease. Prevailing views regard tau as a protein that undergoes abnormal phosphorylation prior to its accumulation into the toxic aggregates implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, the phosphorylation of tau may, in fact, represent part of the normal but interrupted function and catabolism of the protein. In addition to phosphorylation, tau undergoes another forms of post-translational modification including (but not limited to), acetylation, ubiquitination, glycation, glycosylation, SUMOylation, methylation, oxidation, and nitration. A holistic appreciation of how these PTMs regulate tau during health and are potentially hijacked in disease remains elusive. Recent studies have reinforced the idea that PTMs play a critical role in tau localization, protein-protein interactions, maintenance of levels, and modifying aggregate structure. These studies also provide tantalizing clues into the possibility that neurons actively choose how tau is post-translationally modified, in potentially competitive and combinatorial ways, to achieve broad, cellular programs commensurate with the distinctive environmental conditions found during development, aging, stress, and disease. Here, we review tau PTMs and describe what is currently known about their functional impacts. In addition, we classify these PTMs from the perspectives of protein localization, electrostatics, and stability, which all contribute to normal tau function and homeostasis. Finally, we assess the potential impact of tau PTMs on tau solubility and aggregation. Tau occupies an undoubtedly important position in the biology of neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to provide an integrated perspective of how post-translational modifications actively, purposefully, and dynamically remodel tau function, clearance, and aggregation. In doing so, we hope to enable a more comprehensive understanding of tau PTMs that will positively impact future studies.",

However, little is known about whether, and to what extent, non-verbal cognitive abilities, such as processing speed, are impacted in PPA patients. This is because neuropsychological tests typically contain linguistic stimuli and require spoken output, being therefore sensitive to verbal deficits in aphasic patients. The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in processing speed between PPA patients and healthy controls, and among the three PPA variants, using a brief non-verbal tablet-based task (Match) modeled after the WAIS-III digit symbol coding test, and to determine its neural correlates. Here, we compared performance on the Match task between PPA patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 59) and across the three PPA variants. We correlated performance on Match with voxelwise gray and white matter volumes. We found that lvPPA and nfvPPA patients performed significantly worse on Match than healthy controls and svPPA patients. Worse performance on Match across PPA patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in specific parts of the left middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus, and reduced white matter volume in the left parietal lobe. To conclude, our behavioral findings reveal that processing speed is differentially impacted across the three PPA variants and provide support for the potential clinical utility of a tabled-based task (Match) to assess non-verbal cognition. In addition, our neuroimaging findings confirm the importance of a set of fronto-parietal regions that previous research has associated with processing speed and executive control. Finally, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings combined indicate that differences in processing speed are largely explained by the unequal distribution of atrophy in these fronto-parietal regions across the three PPA variants.",

We analyzed speech, language, and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g., PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with etiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated utilizing linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS, and 6 PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by nonfluent speech, executive dysfunction, and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between FTLD neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance ([i] severity-agrammatism, [ii] prominent AOS, and [iii] prominent dysarthria). None of these data-driven LCD allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute, and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",

Conventional 3D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques suffer from long acquisition times, motion artifacts, and limited spatiotemporal resolution. This study proposes a novel time-resolved 3D cardiopulmonary MRI reconstruction method based on spatial transformer networks (STNs) to reconstruct the 3D cardiopulmonary MRI acquired using 3D center-out radial ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequences. The proposed reconstruction method employed an STN-based deep learning framework, which used a combination of data-processing, grid generator, and sampler. The reconstructed 3D images were compared against the start-of-the-art time-resolved reconstruction method. The results showed that the proposed time-resolved 3D cardiopulmonary MRI reconstruction using STNs offers a robust and efficient approach to obtain high-quality images. This method effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional 3D cardiac MRI techniques and has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment planning of cardiopulmonary disorders.",

There are two clinical variants of SD: semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe and insula in the left hemisphere, and semantic behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (sbvFTD), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in those structures in the right hemisphere. Previous studies of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, an associated clinical syndrome that targets the frontal lobes and anterior insula, have found impairments in baseline autonomic nervous system activity that correlate with left-lateralized frontotemporal atrophy patterns and disruptions in socioemotional functioning. Here, we evaluated whether there are similar impairments in resting autonomic nervous system activity in SD that also reflect left-lateralized atrophy and relate to diminished affiliative behavior. A total of 82 participants including 33 people with SD (20 svPPA and 13 sbvFTD) and 49 healthy older controls completed a laboratory-based assessment of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a parasympathetic measure) and skin conductance level (SCL; a sympathetic measure) during a two-minute resting baseline period. Participants also underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging, and informants rated their current affiliative behavior on the Interpersonal Adjective Scale. Results indicated that baseline RSA and SCL were lower in SD than in healthy controls, with significant impairments present in both svPPA and sbvFTD. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed left-greater-than-right atrophy related to diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow in SD. While left-lateralized atrophy in the mid-to-posterior insula correlated with lower RSA, left-lateralized atrophy in the ventral anterior insula correlated with lower SCL. In SD, lower baseline RSA, but not lower SCL, was associated with lower gregariousness/extraversion. Neither autonomic measure related to warmth/agreeableness, however. Through the assessment of baseline autonomic nervous system physiology, the present study contributes to expanding conceptualizations of the biological basis of socioemotional alterations in svPPA and sbvFTD.",

For early-onset AD patients without an identified autosomal dominant cause, we hypothesized that their early-onset disease reflects further enrichment of the common risk-conferring single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. We applied a previously validated polygenic hazard score for late-onset AD to 193 consecutive patients diagnosed at our tertiary dementia referral center with symptomatic early-onset AD. For comparison, we included 179 participants with late-onset AD and 70 healthy controls. Polygenic hazard scores were similar in early- versus late-onset AD. The polygenic hazard score was not associated with age-of-onset or disease biomarkers within early-onset AD. Early-onset AD does not represent an extreme enrichment of the common single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. Further exploration of novel genetic risk factors of this highly heritable disease is warranted.",

            "abstract": "The nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome primarily defined by the presence of apraxia of speech (AoS) and/or expressive agrammatism. In addition, many patients exhibit dysarthria and/or receptive agrammatism. This leads to substantial phenotypic variation within the speech-language domain across individuals and time, in terms of both the specific combination of symptoms as well as their severity. How to resolve such phenotypic heterogeneity in nfvPPA is a matter of debate. \"Splitting\" views propose separate clinical entities: \"primary progressive apraxia of speech\" (PPAOS) when AoS occurs in the absence of expressive agrammatism, \"progressive agrammatic aphasia\" (PAA) in the opposite case, and \"AOS + PAA\" when mixed motor speech and language symptoms are clearly present. While therapeutic interventions typically vary depending on the predominant symptom (e.g., AoS vs expressive agrammatism), the existence of behavioral, anatomical, and pathological overlap across these phenotypes argues against drawing such clear-cut boundaries. In the current study, we contribute to this debate by mapping behavior to brain in a large, prospective cohort of well-characterized patients with nfvPPA (n = 104). We sought to advance scientific understanding of nfvPPA and the neural basis of speech-language by uncovering where in the brain the degree of MRI-based atrophy is associated with inter-patient variability in the presence and severity of AoS, dysarthria, expressive agrammatism, or receptive agrammatism. Our cross-sectional examination of brain-behavior relationships revealed three main observations. First, we found that the neural correlates of AoS and expressive agrammatism in nfvPPA lie side by side in the left posterior inferior frontal lobe, explaining their behavioral dissociation/association in previous reports. Second, we identified a \"left-right\" and \"ventral-dorsal\" neuroanatomical distinction between AoS versus dysarthria, highlighting (i) that dysarthria, but not AoS, is significantly influenced by tissue loss in right-hemisphere motor-speech regions and (ii) that, within the left hemisphere, dysarthria and AoS map onto dorsally versus ventrally located motor-speech regions, respectively. Third, we confirmed that, within the large-scale grammar network, left frontal tissue loss is preferentially involved in expressive agrammatism and left temporal tissue loss in receptive agrammatism. Our findings thus contribute to define the function and location of the epicenters within the large-scale neural networks vulnerable to neurodegenerative changes in nfvPPA. We propose that nfvPPA be redefined as an umbrella term subsuming a spectrum of speech and/or language phenotypes that are closely linked by the underlying neuroanatomy and neuropathology.",

            "abstract": "Globally, a rapid demographic transition is occurring with a significant increment in the proportion of older individuals. For the first time in history, individuals aged 65 and above outnumber that of children under 5 years of age. In Ethiopia, the life expectancy has shown dramatic improvements in the past few decades and is expected to reach 74 years by mid-century. Older age is considered the most important non-modifiable risk factor for dementia. Likewise, other modifiable diseases such as infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, and traumatic brain injuries are associated with dementia. Despite, the high prevalence of dementia risk factors and impending economic and health impact from dementia, no country in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Ethiopia, has developed a standalone or an integrated national dementia strategic plan to guide the overall effort to improve dementia care in the country. It is vital to design and develop a national dementia plan in line with a framework outlined by the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) global action plan. The health, social, and economic burden from dementia is expected to be high to the developing countries such as Ethiopia unless clear prevention and management strategies are designed at a national level to cascade the care to the primary care level. The planned strategic policy may focus on improving the knowledge and skills of health care professionals. Translation and cultural adaptation of cognitive, functional, and behavioral assessment batteries is of paramount importance in improving the diagnostic accuracy along with availability of advanced imaging, biomarkers, and dementia treatment.",

In a small cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, we previously found an atypical, neuroglial tauopathy in cases harboring a TMEM106B rs1990622 A/A genotype. To test whether TMEM106B genotype affects the risk of developing atypical tauopathy under a recessive genotype model (presence versus absence of two major alleles: A/A vs. A/G and G/G). We characterized the atypical tauopathy neuropathologically and determined its frequency by TMEM106B rs1990622 genotypes in 90 postmortem cases with a primary diagnosis of FTLD/ALS-TDP [mean age at death 65.5 years (±8.1), 40% female]. We investigated the effect of this new atypical tauopathy on demographics and clinical and neuropsychological metrics. We also genotyped TMEM106B in an independent series with phenotypically similar cases. Sixteen cases (16/90, 17.7 %) showed the temporal-predominant neuro-astroglial tauopathy, and 93.7% of them carried an A/A genotype (vs. ~35% in a population cohort). The odds ratio of FTLD/ALS-TDP individuals with the A/A genotype showing neuro-astroglial tauopathy was 13.9. Individuals with this tauopathy were older at onset (p = 0.01). The validation cohort had a similarly high proportion of rs1990622 A/A genotype. TDP-43 and tau changes co-occur in a subset of neurons. Our data add to the growing body of evidence that TMEM106B polymorphisms may modulate neurodegeneration. A distinctive medial temporal predominant, 4-repeat, neuro-astroglial tauopathy strongly correlates to TMEM106B A/A genotype in FTLD/ALS-TDP cases.",

Here, we explore how considering these issues with respect to key neuroscientific and clinical details such as conditions and brain regions can aid interpretations of changes in core personal traits. We describe how clinicians treating Parkinson’s disease or obsessive-compulsive disorder tailor DBS within the same region, the subthalamic nucleus, to either avoid or target limbic circuitry linked to mood and emotion, respectively. This demonstrates how similar effects can be considered negative or positive depending on the condition and treatment goals. We then outline how patient and caregiver perspectives and computational models of behavior may help identify and characterize potential changes in core personal traits. Finally, we highlight the need to avoid reductionist views that obscure the role of psychosocial components of neuropsychiatric symptoms that are critical for clinical management and ethical analysis and warn against uni-dimensional neurotechnological solutions for complex psychiatric conditions. Overall, we argue that identifying and managing changes in core personal traits in the context of DBS requires careful accounting for the neuroscientific and clinical context of each case.",

Another framework of moral cognition, the two-dimensional model of utilitarian psychology, posits that utilitarian choices may reflect either instrumental harm, i.e., inflicting harm on an individual for the greater good; or impartial beneficence, i.e., impartially and altruistically acting for the benefit of the overall welfare. We evaluated preregistered hypotheses (https://osf.io/m425d) derived from these models of moral cognition in a sample of 275 neurologically healthy older adults. Our results suggest that both the dual process and two-dimensional models provided insights regarding utilitarian reasoning, including three cardinal domains of conflict between utilitarianism and common-sense morality: agent-centered permissions, special obligations, and personal rights. One prediction of the dual process-based model was supported by our findings, with higher emotionality associated with decreased endorsement of utilitarian judgments (",

Many diverse methods have been proposed to generate accurate and robust QSM images. In this study, we evaluated the performance of different dipole inversion algorithms for iron-sensitive susceptibility imaging at 7T on healthy subjects of a large age range and patients with HD. We compared an iterative least-squares-based method (iLSQR), iterative methods that use regularization, single-step approaches, and deep learning-based techniques. Their performance was evaluated by comparing: (1) deviations from a multiple-orientation QSM reference; (2) visual appearance of QSM maps and the presence of artifacts; (3) susceptibility in subcortical brain regions with age; (4) regional brain susceptibility with published postmortem brain iron quantification; and (5) susceptibility in HD-affected basal ganglia regions between HD subjects and healthy controls. We found that single-step QSM methods with either total variation or total generalized variation constraints (SSTV/SSTGV) and the single-step deep learning method iQSM generally provided the best performance in terms of correlation with iron deposition and were better at differentiating between healthy controls and premanifest HD individuals, while deep learning QSM methods trained with multiple-orientation susceptibility data created QSM maps that were most similar to the multiple orientation reference and with the best visual scores.",

We hypothesized that by developing a new metric, the Severity Factor (S-Factor) using immutable disease parameters, it would be possible to capture disease severity independent of clinical rating scales. Extracting data from the CRC-SCA and READISCA natural history studies, we calculated the S-Factor for 438 participants with symptomatic SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6, as follows: ((length of CAG repeat expansion - maximum normal repeat length) /maximum normal repeat length) × (current age - age at disease onset) × 10). Within each SCA type, the S-Factor at the first Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) visit (baseline) was correlated against scores on SARA and other motor and cognitive assessments. In 281 participants with longitudinal data, the slope of the S-Factor over time was correlated against slopes of scores on SARA and other motor rating scales. At baseline, the S-Factor showed moderate-to-strong correlations with SARA and other motor rating scales at the group level, but not with cognitive performance. Longitudinally the S-Factor slope showed no consistent association with the slope of performance on motor scales. Approximately 30% of SARA slopes reflected a trend of non-progression in motor symptoms. The S-Factor is an observer-independent metric of disease burden in SCAs. It may be useful at the group level to compare cohorts at baseline in clinical studies. Derivation and examination of the S-factor highlighted challenges in the use of clinical rating scales in this population.",

            "abstract": "Prior research has revealed distinctive patterns of impaired language abilities across the three variants of Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA): nonfluent/agrammatic (nfvPPA), logopenic (lvPPA) and semantic (svPPA). However, little is known about whether, and to what extent, non-verbal cognitive abilities, such as processing speed, are impacted in PPA patients. This is because neuropsychological tests typically contain linguistic stimuli and require spoken output, being therefore sensitive to verbal deficits in aphasic patients. The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in processing speed between PPA patients and healthy controls, and among the three PPA variants, using a brief non-verbal tablet-based task (Match) modeled after the WAIS-III digit symbol coding test, and to determine its neural correlates. Here, we compared performance on the Match task between PPA patients (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 59) and across the three PPA variants. We correlated performance on Match with voxelwise gray and white matter volumes. We found that lvPPA and nfvPPA patients performed significantly worse on Match than healthy controls and svPPA patients. Worse performance on Match across PPA patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in specific parts of the left middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus, and reduced white matter volume in the left parietal lobe. To conclude, our behavioral findings reveal that processing speed is differentially impacted across the three PPA variants and provide support for the potential clinical utility of a tabled-based task (Match) to assess non-verbal cognition. In addition, our neuroimaging findings confirm the importance of a set of fronto-parietal regions that previous research has associated with processing speed and executive control. Finally, our behavioral and neuroimaging findings combined indicate that differences in processing speed are largely explained by the unequal distribution of atrophy in these fronto-parietal regions across the three PPA variants.",

However, the neuroanatomical correlates of auditory difficulties in DD and their contribution to individual clinical phenotypes are still unknown. Recent intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) findings associated processing of sound amplitude rises and speech sounds with posterior and middle superior temporal gyrus (STG), respectively. We hypothesize that regional STG anatomy will relate to specific auditory abilities in DD and that auditory processing abilities will relate to behavioral difficulties. One hundred and ten children (78 DD, 32 typically developing, age 7-15 years) completed amplitude rise time (ART) and speech in noise discrimination (SiN) tasks. They also underwent a battery of cognitive tests. Anatomical MRI scans were used to identify regions in which local cortical gyrification complexity correlated with auditory tasks in DD. Behaviorally, ART but not SiN performance was impaired in DD. Neurally, ART and SiN performance correlated with gyrification in posterior STG and middle STG, respectively. Furthermore, ART significantly contributed to reading impairments in DD, while SiN explained variance in phonological awareness only. Finally, ART and SiN performance was not correlated, and each task was correlated with distinct neuropsychological measures, such that distinct DD subgroups could be identified. Overall, we provide a direct link between the neurodevelopment of the left STG and individual variability in auditory processing abilities in DD. The dissociation between speech and non-speech deficits supports distinct DD phenotypes and implicates different approaches to interventions.",

In the present investigation, levels of radon, thoron and their progeny are studied in 110 houses in the coastal region of the Kollam district in the state of Kerala, India using the multi-detector twin cup dosimeter. Among these, 10 houses were studied in detail with five dosimeters in each house. Radon activity concentrations were found to vary from 7 to 100 Bqm(-3) and that of thoron from 4 to 66 Bqm(-3) in Neendakara panchayat. In Chavara panchayat, the variations of radon concentrations were from 7 to 83 Bqm(-3) and thoron concentrations were varied from 4 to 86 Bqm(-3). The occurrence of radon and thoron concentrations in the dwellings for both study areas shows that in 50% of the dwellings, the concentration of radon is about 25 Bqm(-3) and in 60% of the dwellings thoron concentration is about 15 Bqm(-3). The ratio of thoron-to-radon concentrations in the dwellings showed a mean value 0.55 (GM=0.45) for the region.",

There are two clinical variants of SD: semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe and insula in the left hemisphere, and semantic behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (sbvFTD), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in those structures in the right hemisphere. Previous studies of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, an associated clinical syndrome that targets the frontal lobes and anterior insula, have found impairments in baseline autonomic nervous system activity that correlate with left-lateralized frontotemporal atrophy patterns and disruptions in socioemotional functioning. Here, we evaluated whether there are similar impairments in resting autonomic nervous system activity in SD that also reflect left-lateralized atrophy and relate to diminished affiliative behavior. A total of 82 participants including 33 people with SD (20 svPPA and 13 sbvFTD) and 49 healthy older controls completed a laboratory-based assessment of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a parasympathetic measure) and skin conductance level (SCL; a sympathetic measure) during a two-minute resting baseline period. Participants also underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging, and informants rated their current affiliative behavior on the Interpersonal Adjective Scale. Results indicated that baseline RSA and SCL were lower in SD than in healthy controls, with significant impairments present in both svPPA and sbvFTD. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed left-greater-than-right atrophy related to diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow in SD. While left-lateralized atrophy in the mid-to-posterior insula correlated with lower RSA, left-lateralized atrophy in the ventral anterior insula correlated with lower SCL. In SD, lower baseline RSA, but not lower SCL, was associated with lower gregariousness/extraversion. Neither autonomic measure related to warmth/agreeableness, however. Through the assessment of baseline autonomic nervous system physiology, the present study contributes to expanding conceptualizations of the biological basis of socioemotional alterations in svPPA and sbvFTD.",

We define authenticity as being true to oneself and consider it a social value of relevance to neuroscientists, clinicians, and caregivers. From a biological perspective, behaviors that can be interpreted as expressions of authenticity are produced by distributed brain networks. By understanding it as a dynamic process, we argue that harnessing authenticity across the lifespan can be protective by promoting resilience. We discuss the idea of authentic aging, which appreciates the complexity of human life within the world and can enhance positive views of later life. Authenticity is additionally applicable to caring for people with neurodegenerative diseases, both when understanding the behavior of people with dementia and the response of caregivers. Tailoring care to an individual's personality and strengths may improve their brain health. Finally, we describe an interdisciplinary learning event, themed around masks, designed to engage participants in identifying authenticity in their own work. For scientists, care professionals, and caregivers, reflecting upon authenticity can aid understanding of the person with dementia and therefore improve care.",

Little is known about how these structural imbalances impact clinical symptomatology. The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of frontotemporal asymmetry (right- or left-lateralization) and dorsality (ventral or dorsal predominance of atrophy) and to investigate their clinical correlates. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and structural images were analyzed for 250 patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal atrophy was most often symmetric while left-lateralized (9%) and right-lateralized (17%) atrophy were present in a minority of patients. Atrophy was more often ventral (32%) than dorsal (3%) predominant. Patients with right-lateralized atrophy were characterized by higher severity of abnormal eating behavior and hallucinations compared to those with left-lateralized atrophy. Subsequent analyses clarified that eating behavior was associated with right atrophy to a greater extent than a lack of left atrophy, and hallucinations were driven mainly by right atrophy. Dorsality analyses showed that anxiety, euphoria, and disinhibition correlated with ventral-predominant atrophy. Agitation, irritability, and depression showed greater severity with a lack of regional atrophy, including in dorsal regions. Aberrant motor behavior and apathy were not explained by asymmetry or dorsality. This study provides additional insight into how anatomical heterogeneity influences the clinical presentation of patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Behavioral symptoms can be associated not only with the presence or absence of focal atrophy, but also with right/left or dorsal/ventral imbalance of gray matter volume.",

We investigated the structural neuroanatomical correlates of emotional granularity in 58 healthy, older adults (ages 62-84 years), who have had a lifetime to accrue and deploy their conceptual knowledge of emotions.

Atrophy patterns have also been associated with broadly recognized syndromes that bring together multiple symptoms, such as the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia. There is substantial heterogeneity of symptoms, with partial overlap of behaviour and affected neuroanatomy across and within dementia subtypes. It is not well established if there are anatomically distinct behavioural subphenotypes in neurodegenerative disease. The objective of this study was to identify shared behavioural profiles in frontotemporal dementia-spectrum and Alzheimer's disease-related syndromes. Additionally, we sought to determine the underlying neural correlates of these symptom clusters. Two hundred and eighty-one patients diagnosed with one of seven different dementia syndromes, in addition to healthy controls and individuals with mild cognitive impairment, completed a 109-item assessment capturing the severity of a range of clinical behaviours. A principal component analysis captured distinct clusters of related behaviours. Voxel-based morphometry analyses were used to identify regions of volume loss associated with each component. Seven components were identified and interpreted as capturing the following behaviours: Component 1-emotional bluntness, 2-emotional lability and disinhibition, 3-neuroticism, 4-rigidity and impatience, 5-indiscriminate consumption, 6-psychosis and 7-Geschwind syndrome-related behaviours. Correlations with structural brain volume revealed distinct neuroanatomical patterns associated with each component, including after controlling for diagnosis, suggesting that localized neurodegeneration can lead to the development of behavioural symptom clusters across various dementia syndromes.",

About 20-25% of individuals with FTLD are estimated to carry a mutation associated with a specific FTLD pathology. The discovery of these mutations has led to important advances in potentially disease-modifying treatments that aim to slow progression or delay disease onset and has improved understanding of brain functioning. In both mutation carriers and those with sporadic disease, the most common underlying diagnoses are linked to neuronal and glial inclusions containing tau (FTLD-tau) or TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), although 5-10% of patients may have inclusions containing proteins from the FUS-Ewing sarcoma-TAF15 family (FTLD-FET). Biomarkers definitively identifying specific pathological entities in sporadic disease have been elusive, which has impeded development of disease-modifying treatments. Nevertheless, disease-monitoring biofluid and imaging biomarkers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are likely to serve as useful measures of treatment response during trials of disease-modifying treatments. Symptomatic trials using novel approaches such as transcranial direct current stimulation are also beginning to show promise.",

We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews among key decision makers to identify implementation strategies and target groups in South Africa, India, and China. Thematic and deductive analysis using a coding framework were used to identify themes across and within settings. In all three countries there was interest in novel TB vaccines, with school-attending adolescents named as a likely target group. In China and India, older people were also identified as a target group. Routine vaccination was preferred in all countries due to stigma and logistical issues with targeted mass campaigns. Perceived benefits for implementation of M72/AS01E were the likely efficacy in individuals with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and efficacy for people living with HIV. Perceived challenges for M72/AS01E included the infrastructure and the two-dose regimen required. Stakeholders valued the familiarity of BCG but were concerned about the adverse effects in people living with HIV, a particular concern in South Africa. Implementation challenges and opportunities were identified in all three countries. Our study provides crucial information for implementing novel TB vaccines in specific target groups and on country specific acceptability and feasibility. Key groups for vaccine implementation in these settings were identified, and should be included in clinical trials and implementation planning.",

We measured emotional empathy over time (range = 0 - 7.3 years, mean = 2.4 years) in 86 older adults during a period in which they were cognitively healthy, functionally normal, and free of dementia symptoms. For each participant, we computed longitudinal trajectories for empathic concern (i.e., an other-oriented form of emotional empathy that promotes prosocial actions) and emotional contagion (i.e., a self-focused form of emotional empathy often accompanied by feelings of distress) from informant ratings of participants' empathy on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) scans were used to classify participants as either Aβ positive (Aβ+, n = 23) or negative (Aβ-, n = 63) based on Aβ-PET cortical binding. Participants also underwent structural and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging approximately two years on average after their last empathy assessment, at which time most participants remained cognitively healthy. Results indicated that empathic concern, but not emotional contagion, increased more over time in Aβ+ participants than in Aβ- participants despite no initial group difference at the first measurement. Higher connectivity between certain salience network node-pairs (i.e., pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray) predicted longitudinal increases in empathic concern in the Aβ+ group but not in the Aβ- group. The Aβ+ participants also had higher overall salience network connectivity than Aβ- participants despite no differences in gray matter volume. These results suggest gains in empathic concern may be a very early feature of AD pathophysiology that relates to hyperconnectivity in the salience network, a system that supports emotion generation and interoception. A better understanding of emotional empathy trajectories in the early stages of AD pathophysiology will broaden the lens on preclinical AD changes and help clinicians to identify older adults who should be screened for AD biomarkers.",

Recently, we reported a progressive frontotemporal dementia-like clinical syndrome in a patient with a mutation in TSC1, but the neuropathological changes seen in adults with TSC with or without dementia have yet to be systematically explored. Here, we examined neuropathological findings in adults with TSC (n = 11) aged 30-58 years and compared them to age-matched patients with epilepsy unrelated to TSC (n = 9) and non-neurological controls (n = 10). In 3 of 11 subjects with TSC, we observed a neurofibrillary tangle-predominant \"TSC tauopathy\" not seen in epilepsy or non-neurological controls. This tauopathy was observed in the absence of pathological amyloid beta, TDP-43, or alpha-synuclein deposition. The neurofibrillary tangles in TSC tauopathy showed a unique pattern of post-translational modifications, with apparent differences between TSC1 and TSC2 mutation carriers. Tau acetylation (K274, K343) was prominent in both TSC1 and TSC2, whereas tau phosphorylation at a common phospho-epitope (S202) was observed only in TSC2. TSC tauopathy was observed in selected neocortical, limbic, subcortical, and brainstem sites and showed a 3-repeat greater than 4-repeat tau isoform pattern in both TSC1 and TSC2 mutation carriers, but no tangles were immunolabeled with MC1 or p62 antibodies. The findings suggest that individuals with TSC are at risk for a unique tauopathy in mid-life and that tauopathy pathogenesis may involve TSC1, TSC2, and related molecular pathways.",

First, we show that the lateral entorhinal cortex, an early site of tau neurofibrillary tangle formation, is subject to remote, connectivity-mediated amyloid-beta/tau interactions linked to initial tau spreading. Second, we identify the inferior temporal gyrus as the region featuring the greatest local amyloid-beta/tau interactions and a connectivity profile well suited to accelerate tau propagation.

It contributes to improved rights of people living with mental health conditions and access to care services. However, in Ethiopia, mental health advocacy faces obstacles such as deep-rooted misconceptions, fear, and discrimination about mental illness, as well limited engagement of stakeholders and language barriers. Both mainstream and social media play a large role in disseminating mental health topics in Ethiopia. However, they need organized initiatives and efforts in order to be successful in promoting mental health awareness to the public. Implementing a comprehensive strategy comprising public awareness campaigns, policy advocacy, community engagement, stakeholder collaboration, responsible reporting, and increased coverage of mental health topics is crucial. The World Health Organization also emphasizes the role of health ministries in supporting mental health advocacy efforts. By promoting education, challenging stigmas, and improving access to mental health services, media advocacy can contribute to creating a more informed and supportive society for individuals with mental illness in Ethiopia.",

These values guide us as we advocate for reducing the global impact of dementia. By taking a values-based approach to brain health, we can drive global changes for millions of people. Respect fortifies gratitude and embraces diversity. Philosophical discussions of the ideas support the assertion that respect is crucial in everyday conversations and actions as well as in personal, social, political, and moral spheres. No one can become a leader unless they genuinely respect and care about the success of each team member. Diversity, equity, and inclusivity form the fundamental cornerstones of respect. Understanding this core value of respect will ensure altruistic behavior among the leaders that may help mitigate racism, cultural insults, gender discrimination, stigmatization, religious hatred, and, worst of all, poor leadership abilities that have been the disconcerting examples of disrespect in recent years. We present the underlying neurobiology of respect and its impact on equity and leadership.",

The potential combination of risk factors that influence aging across populations in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries is unknown. Compared to other regions where classical factors such as age and sex drive healthy aging, higher disparity-related factors and between-country variability could influence healthy aging in LAC countries. We investigated the combined impact of social determinants of health (SDH), lifestyle factors, cardiometabolic factors, mental health symptoms and demographics (age, sex) on healthy aging (cognition and functional ability) across LAC countries with different levels of socioeconomic development using cross-sectional and longitudinal machine learning models (n = 44,394 participants). Risk factors associated with social and health disparities, including SDH (β > 0.3), mental health (β > 0.6) and cardiometabolic risks (β > 0.22), significantly influenced healthy aging more than age and sex (with null or smaller effects: β < 0.2). These heterogeneous patterns were more pronounced in low-income to middle-income LAC countries compared to high-income LAC countries (cross-sectional comparisons), and in an upper-income to middle-income LAC country, Costa Rica, compared to China, a non-upper-income to middle-income LAC country (longitudinal comparisons). These inequity-associated and region-specific patterns inform national risk assessments of healthy aging in LAC countries and regionally tailored public health interventions.",

For the first time in history, individuals aged 65 and above outnumber that of children under 5 years of age. In Ethiopia, the life expectancy has shown dramatic improvements in the past few decades and is expected to reach 74 years by mid-century. Older age is considered the most important non-modifiable risk factor for dementia. Likewise, other modifiable diseases such as infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases, and traumatic brain injuries are associated with dementia. Despite, the high prevalence of dementia risk factors and impending economic and health impact from dementia, no country in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Ethiopia, has developed a standalone or an integrated national dementia strategic plan to guide the overall effort to improve dementia care in the country. It is vital to design and develop a national dementia plan in line with a framework outlined by the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) global action plan. The health, social, and economic burden from dementia is expected to be high to the developing countries such as Ethiopia unless clear prevention and management strategies are designed at a national level to cascade the care to the primary care level. The planned strategic policy may focus on improving the knowledge and skills of health care professionals. Translation and cultural adaptation of cognitive, functional, and behavioral assessment batteries is of paramount importance in improving the diagnostic accuracy along with availability of advanced imaging, biomarkers, and dementia treatment.",

This paper is a critical review of functional and structural neuroimaging studies of these symptoms transdiagnostically in dementia of the Alzheimer type, which is characterized by prominent amnesia early in the disease course, and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, characterized by early social-comportmental deficits. We describe the prevalence and clinical correlates of these symptoms and describe methodological issues, including difficulties with symptom definition and different measurement instruments. We highlight the heterogeneity of findings, noting however, a striking similarity of the set of brain regions implicated across clinical diagnoses and symptoms. These regions involve several key nodes of the salience network, and we describe the functions and anatomical connectivity of these brain areas, as well as present a new theoretical account of disinhibition in dementia. Future avenues for research are discussed, including the importance of transdiagnostic studies, measuring subdomains of apathy and disinhibition, and examining different units of analysis for deepening our understanding of the networks and mechanisms underlying these extremely distressing symptoms.",

We analyzed speech, language, and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g., PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with etiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated utilizing linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS, and 6 PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by nonfluent speech, executive dysfunction, and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between FTLD neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance ([i] severity-agrammatism, [ii] prominent AOS, and [iii] prominent dysarthria). None of these data-driven LCD allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute, and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",

Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.",

The extent to which dominantly inherited and sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease overlap is unknown. In this study, we explored the clinical, cognitive and biomarker profiles of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, focusing on commonalities and distinctions between dominantly inherited and sporadic cases. Our analysis included 117 participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and 118 individuals with sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease enrolled at the University of California San Francisco Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Baseline differences in clinical and biomarker profiles between both groups were compared using ",

            "abstract": "In semantic dementia (SD), asymmetric degeneration of the anterior temporal lobes is associated with loss of semantic knowledge and alterations in socioemotional behavior. There are two clinical variants of SD: semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe and insula in the left hemisphere, and semantic behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (sbvFTD), which is characterized by predominant atrophy in those structures in the right hemisphere. Previous studies of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, an associated clinical syndrome that targets the frontal lobes and anterior insula, have found impairments in baseline autonomic nervous system activity that correlate with left-lateralized frontotemporal atrophy patterns and disruptions in socioemotional functioning. Here, we evaluated whether there are similar impairments in resting autonomic nervous system activity in SD that also reflect left-lateralized atrophy and relate to diminished affiliative behavior. A total of 82 participants including 33 people with SD (20 svPPA and 13 sbvFTD) and 49 healthy older controls completed a laboratory-based assessment of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a parasympathetic measure) and skin conductance level (SCL; a sympathetic measure) during a two-minute resting baseline period. Participants also underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging, and informants rated their current affiliative behavior on the Interpersonal Adjective Scale. Results indicated that baseline RSA and SCL were lower in SD than in healthy controls, with significant impairments present in both svPPA and sbvFTD. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed left-greater-than-right atrophy related to diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow in SD. While left-lateralized atrophy in the mid-to-posterior insula correlated with lower RSA, left-lateralized atrophy in the ventral anterior insula correlated with lower SCL. In SD, lower baseline RSA, but not lower SCL, was associated with lower gregariousness/extraversion. Neither autonomic measure related to warmth/agreeableness, however. Through the assessment of baseline autonomic nervous system physiology, the present study contributes to expanding conceptualizations of the biological basis of socioemotional alterations in svPPA and sbvFTD.",

For early-onset AD patients without an identified autosomal dominant cause, we hypothesized that their early-onset disease reflects further enrichment of the common risk-conferring single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. We applied a previously validated polygenic hazard score for late-onset AD to 193 consecutive patients diagnosed at our tertiary dementia referral center with symptomatic early-onset AD. For comparison, we included 179 participants with late-onset AD and 70 healthy controls. Polygenic hazard scores were similar in early- versus late-onset AD. The polygenic hazard score was not associated with age-of-onset or disease biomarkers within early-onset AD. Early-onset AD does not represent an extreme enrichment of the common single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with late-onset AD. Further exploration of novel genetic risk factors of this highly heritable disease is warranted.",

            "abstract": "It is debated whether primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) and progressive agrammatic aphasia (PAA) belong to the same clinical spectrum traditionally termed nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) or exist as two completely distinct syndromic entities with specific pathologic/prognostic correlates. We analyzed speech, language, and disease severity features in a comprehensive cohort of patients with progressive motor speech impairment and/or agrammatism to ascertain evidence of naturally occurring, clinically meaningful non-overlapping syndromic entities (e.g., PPAOS and PAA) in our data. We also assessed if data-driven latent clinical dimensions with etiologic/prognostic value could be identified. We included 98 participants, 43 of whom had an autopsy-confirmed neuropathological diagnosis. Speech pathologists assessed motor speech features indicative of dysarthria and apraxia of speech (AOS). Quantitative expressive/receptive agrammatism measures were obtained and compared with healthy controls. Baseline and longitudinal disease severity was evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB). We investigated the data's clustering tendency and cluster stability to form robust symptom clusters and employed principal component analysis to extract data-driven latent clinical dimensions (LCD). The longitudinal CDR-SB change was estimated utilizing linear mixed-effects models. Of the participants included in this study, 93 conformed to previously reported clinical profiles (75 with AOS and agrammatism, 12 PPAOS, and 6 PAA). The remaining five participants were characterized by nonfluent speech, executive dysfunction, and dysarthria without apraxia of speech or frank agrammatism. No baseline clinical features differentiated between FTLD neuropathological subgroups. The Hopkins statistic demonstrated a low cluster tendency in the entire sample (.45 with values near 0.5 indicating random data). Cluster stability analyses showed that only two robust subgroups (differing in agrammatism, executive dysfunction and overall disease severity) could be identified. Three data-driven components accounted for 71% of the variance ([i] severity-agrammatism, [ii] prominent AOS, and [iii] prominent dysarthria). None of these data-driven LCD allowed an accurate prediction of neuropathology. The severity-agrammatism component was an independent predictor of a faster CDR-SB increase in all the participants. Higher dysarthria severity, reduced words per minute, and expressive and receptive agrammatism severity at baseline independently predicted accelerated disease progression. Our findings indicate that PPAOS and PAA, rather than exist as completely distinct syndromic entities, constitute a clinical continuum. In our cohort, splitting the nfvPPA spectrum into separate clinical phenotypes did not improve clinical-pathological correlations, stressing the need for new biological markers and consensus regarding updated terminology and clinical classification.",

            "abstract": "In frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), pathological protein aggregation is associated with a decline in human-specialized social-emotional and language functions. Most disease protein aggregates contain either TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-tau). Here, we explored whether FTLD targets brain regions that express genes containing human accelerated regions (HARs), conserved sequences that have undergone positive selection during recent human evolution. To this end, we used structural neuroimaging from patients with FTLD and normative human regional transcriptomic data to identify genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions. We then integrated primate comparative genomic data to test our hypothesis that FTLD targets brain regions expressing recently evolved genes. In addition, we asked whether genes expressed in FTLD-targeted brain regions are enriched for genes that undergo cryptic splicing when TDP-43 function is impaired. We found that FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes target brain regions that express overlapping and distinct genes, including many linked to neuromodulatory functions. Genes whose normative brain regional expression pattern correlated with FTLD cortical atrophy were strongly associated with HARs. Atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-TDP showed greater overlap with TDP-43 cryptic splicing genes compared with atrophy-correlated genes in FTLD-tau. Cryptic splicing genes were enriched for HAR genes, and vice versa, but this effect was due to the confounding influence of gene length. Analyses performed at the individual-patient level revealed that the expression of HAR genes and cryptically spliced genes within putative regions of disease onset differed across FTLD-TDP subtypes. Overall, our findings suggest that FTLD targets brain regions that have undergone recent evolutionary specialization and provide intriguing potential leads regarding the transcriptomic basis for selective vulnerability in distinct FTLD molecular-anatomical subtypes.",

            "abstract": "As genetic testing has become more accessible and affordable, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are increasingly identified, and determining whether these variants play causal roles in disease is a major challenge. The known disease-associated Annexin A11 (ANXA11) mutations result in ANXA11 aggregation, alterations in lysosomal-RNA granule co-trafficking, and TDP-43 mis-localization and present as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia. We identified a novel VUS in ANXA11 (P93S) in a kindred with corticobasal syndrome and unique radiographic features that segregated with disease. We then queried neurodegenerative disorder clinic databases to identify the phenotypic spread of ANXA11 mutations. Multi-modal computational analysis of this variant was performed and the effect of this VUS on ANXA11 function and TDP-43 biology was characterized in iPSC-derived neurons. Single-cell sequencing and proteomic analysis of iPSC-derived neurons and microglia were used to determine the multiomic signature of this VUS. Mutations in ANXA11 were found in association with clinically diagnosed corticobasal syndrome, thereby establishing corticobasal syndrome as part of ANXA11 clinical spectrum. In iPSC-derived neurons expressing mutant ANXA11, we found decreased colocalization of lysosomes and decreased neuritic RNA as well as decreased nuclear TDP-43 and increased formation of cryptic exons compared to controls. Multiomic assessment of the P93S variant in iPSC-derived neurons and microglia indicates that the pathogenic omic signature in neurons is modest compared to microglia. Additionally, omic studies reveal that immune dysregulation and interferon signaling pathways in microglia are central to disease. Collectively, these findings identify a new pathogenic variant in ANXA11, expand the range of clinical syndromes caused by ANXA11 mutations, and implicate both neuronal and microglia dysfunction in ANXA11 pathophysiology. This work illustrates the potential for iPSC-derived cellular models to revolutionize the variant annotation process and provides a generalizable approach to determining causality of novel variants across genes.",
